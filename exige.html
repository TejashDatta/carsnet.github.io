    <p>As the ultimate incarnation of the world famous Exige, Lotus has   revealed the Lotus Exige Sport 350, the latest version of the   class-leading and award winning sports car, that's lighter and faster   than ever before.</p>
<p>The new Lotus Exige Sport 350 is the next model   in the range to mark the reintroduction of the renowned 'Sport' naming   designation. It joins the recently announced Lotus Elise Sport and Elise   Sport 220 - delivering a lighter and even more performance-focused   driving experience.</p>
<p>Concentrating on what Lotus does best, and   with a focus on pure performance, the two-seater has been developed to   deliver an unrivalled experience for the driver, being sharper and more   direct than previous models. Drawing on the core elements that have made   the Exige a firm avourite with driving enthusiasts, the Exige Sport 350   combines Lotus' lightweight extruded aluminium chassis structure with   muscular and aerodynamically efficient composite bodywork.</p>
<p>A   product of Lotus' 'Lightweight Laboratory', the Exige Sport 350 weighs   just 1125 kg and has shed 51 kg compared to the previous model Exige S.   This reduction in mass is the result of a thorough re-evaluation   designed to deliver a pure driving experience.</p>
<p>Lotus engineers   weighed every component in the previous Lotus Exige S in order to save   weight, the result of which includes, amongst many other changes, the   introduction of a louvered tailgate panel, a lighter battery,   lightweight engine mounts, a lightweight centre console featuring an   exposed gearshift mechanism, lighter HVAC pipework and the optimised use   of sound insulation.</p>
<p>Jean-Marc Gales, CEO of Group Lotus plc, commented: &quot;The Lotus Exige   is already regarded as one of the world's best sports cars and a   benchmark for performance and handling both on road and on track. With   the Exige Sport 350 we took an already phenomenally quick car and made   it even faster, more dynamic and more pure, perfectly demonstrating our   Lotus design philosophy of 'lighter and faster'.&quot;</p>
<p>The 3.5-litre   supercharged V6 engine generates 345 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque at   4500rpm, offering scintillating, progressive power to the road, while   revised suspension tuning and wheel geometry contribute to un-matched   vehicle dynamics and steering precision. Coupled with the car's lower   mass, this power and torque enables the Lotus Exige Sport 350 to   accelerate to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds (0-100km/h in 3.9 seconds)   before reaching a top speed of 170 mph (274 km/h).</p>
<p>The manual   gearbox has been heavily revised, giving more precise and quicker   shifting. The gearshift mechanism uses light weight machined and cast   aluminium components which are so technically aesthetically appealing   they are no longer hidden within the transmission tunnel but exposed   through an open-gate design, further reducing weight.</p>
<p>The Lotus   Exige Sport 350 is also available with a 6-speed automatic option where   drivers can change gears manually via forged aluminium paddles located   behind the steering wheel, or rely on the gearbox's fully automatic   mode. The automatic gearbox control panel is integrated neatly into the   centre console of the cockpit, with buttons for Park, Reverse, Neutral   and Drive. Up-shifts take just 240 milliseconds, with rapid downshifts   accompanied by automatic throttle-blip (when in Sport mode).</p>
<p>When   fitted with the optional automatic gearbox, the new Exige Sport 350 is   slightly quicker for 0-62 mph (0-100km/h), clocking a time of 3.8   seconds against 3.9 seconds for the manual gearbox, due to   electronically optimised gearshifts.</p>
<p>Replacing the previous car's   glass tailgate, the newly designed lightweight, strong and stiff, rear   louvered tailgate not only helps lower the Exige's centre of gravity,   but also aids engine bay cooling - a feature first introduced on the   Lotus Esprit Turbo in 1980.</p>
<p>The Lotus Exige Sport 350's   aerodynamic styling produces 42 kg of down force at 100 mph (160 km/h)   with the rear wing and flat underside both contributing to its   phenomenal aerodynamic performance and finely balanced handling.</p>
<p>The   Lotus Exige Sport 350's suspension, with firmer dampers and revised   geometry, delivers more responsive handling and, combined with a lowered   centre of gravity and four piston brake calipers, help it lap Lotus'   test track 2.5 seconds faster than the previous Exige S model, in a time   of 1 minute 29.8 seconds. This makes it the first production Lotus ever   to go sub 1 minute 30 seconds around the famed Hethel track.</p>
<p>Lotus   Dynamic Performance Management (DPM) provides three discrete modes -   'Drive', 'Sport' and 'Race' - with the latter offering increased levels   of traction slip threshold, allowing wider drift angles before   intervening. The system also opens the engine exhaust bypass valve at   mid-to-high engine speeds. Both 'Sport' and 'Race' settings increase   throttle responsiveness.</p>
<p>New larger switches with improved haptics   have been introduced for the DPM system (Sport and Race) with the   headlights and rear fog lights mounted together with the vehicle's new   engine start button.</p>
<p>New trim packs introduce a heritage theme to   the cabin with lightweight sports seats and door panels clad in red or   yellow Tartan (leather or Alcantara interior trim options are also   available). The Tartan theme was first introduced in 1976 in the Lotus   Esprit S1 and was a bold statement originally in keeping with the   fashion of the time and now fitting for the new Lotus Exige Sport 350.</p>
<p>Optional   extras for the Lotus Exige Sport 350 include lightweight forged alloy   wheels (reducing kerb weight by a further 5 kg), cross drilled and   vented two-piece brake discs (shaving yet another 5 kg off the weight),   black or yellow painted four-piston callipers, air conditioning, an   in-car entertainment system and full carpet and sound insulation pack.   Interior packs cover Alcantara, leather and Tartan options, for both   seat and door trims. By selecting the lightweight options available the   total weight of the Exige Sport 350 becomes a featherweight 1115 kg.</p>
<p>As   standard, the front splitter, rear wing, front access panel, roof   panel, wing mirrors and rear transom are finished in matt black to   complement the car's aggressive stance; with the option for these   components to be painted in body colour at no additional cost.</p>
<p>Jean-Marc   Gales continued, &quot;Light weight is the most important aspect of our   heritage and future Lotus cars will follow the direction of our most   recently launched models, the Evora 400, Elise Sport and of course our   latest Exige Sport 350, all of which are both lighter and faster than   their predecessors. Over the last 15 years, successive versions of the   Lotus Exige have beaten more expensive sports car rivals in media   comparison tests and I expect the Exige Sport 350 to continue this. The   best has just got better!&quot;</p>
