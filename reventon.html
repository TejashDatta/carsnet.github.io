<h4>The essence of the marque: <span>just 20 examples of a design masterpiece</span>
</h4>
<p>Clearly a Lamborghini, but nothing quite like it. A super car without equals: the Lamborghini Reventón is a road vehicle with an extreme specification and, at the same time, a limited edition masterpiece - a coherent style, angular with sharp lines, inspired by the very latest aeronautics.
</p>
<p>With just 20 produced, each 1 Million Euro (without taxes) Lamborghini Reventón is a symbol of extreme exclusivity, yet still offering the extraordinary performance that makes the Reventón so unrivalled: under the completely autonomous design, the Reventón possesses the entire technical and dynamic competence of the twelve cylinder Lamborghini.
</p>
<p>Lamborghini prides itself on being the extraordinary manufacturer of extreme super sports cars without compromise. Sensuality and provocation characterise every Lamborghini, with an aggressively innovative style. "However, the Reventón is the most extreme of all, a true automotive superlative. Our designers at the Lamborghini Style Centre took the technical base of the Murciélago LP640 and compressed and intensified its DNA, its genetic code," affirms Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.
</p>
<h4>Born in Sant'Agata Bolognese
</h4>
<p>The Lamborghini Reventón has been entirely designed in Sant'Agata Bolognese, the original birthplace of the Lamborghini and the native home of every super car born under the sign of the bull. The design drawn up in Lamborghini's Centro Stile (Style Centre) is fine-tuned in close collaboration with the Lamborghini Research and Development Department. Thus, the Reventón is not only "haute couture" but it also stands out for its elevated dynamism whilst being entirely suitable for every day use.
</p>
<p>The Lamborghini Reventón is not destined to remain a one-off. A total   of 20 Lamborghini friends and collectors will be able to own this   extraordinary car and, naturally, enjoy the incomparable pleasure of   driving it.</p>
<p>The name Reventón has been chosen according to   Lamborghini tradition. Reventón was a fighting bull, owned by the Don   Rodriguez family. It is included in the list of the most famous bulls   ever and is known for killing the famed bullfighter Felix Guzman in   1943.</p>
<h4>Inspired by the fastest airplanes</h4>
<p>The   present day Lamborghini models are distinguished by the clear language   of their shape. The coherent proportions of the Murciélago and Gallardo   highlight their power and dynamism. Sharp edges, precise lines and clean   surfaces: these are ingredients of a style reduced to the essential.   Each element is created exactly according to its function; ornaments and   decorations are totally foreign to a Lamborghini.</p>
<p>With the   Reventón the Centro Stile designers have coherently developed this   philosophy, inspired by another sphere where speed and dynamism reign   absolute: modern aeronautics, responsible for the fastest and most agile   airplanes in the world. This has created an extremely precise,   technically striking style with a new vitality: interrupted lines and   contorted surfaces create a fascinating play of light, giving the car   incredible movement.</p>
<h4>Made of carbon fibre and precision</h4>
<p>Although   it is based on the extraordinarily successful Murciélago LP640, the   exterior design of the Reventón is completely new. Just like the base   model, the exterior is made of CFC, a composite carbon fibre material,   which is as stable as it is light. The exterior components are glued and   fixed to the body comprised of CFC and steel.</p>
<p>The front is   characterised by the acute angle of the central 'arrow' and by the   powerful forward-facing air intakes. Although they do not supply air   directly to the turbine like an airplane, bearing in mind the 650 hp, an   abundant volume of air is necessary to cool the carbon brake disks and   the six cylinder callipers.</p>
<h4>Characterised by coherent functions</h4>
<p>Naturally,   both doors on the Reventón open upwards - since the legendary Countach   this has also been a symbol of the V12 Lamborghini product line. With   their asymmetric configuration, the large air intakes below the doors   provide an example of the extreme coherence with which a Lamborghini   fulfils its function: on the driver's side it is large to increase the   flow of oil to the radiator. On the passenger's side of the vehicle, the   air intake is flat because in this case, it only has to ensure the flow   below the floor. The aerodynamically optimised flat floor structure   terminates at the rear with a diffuser featuring an accentuated shape.   This guarantees excellent road grip and stability even at 340 km per   hour.</p>
<p>In spite of the extreme and innovative language of its   shape, the Reventón not only maintains all the strong features of the   Murciélago LP640, but also offers further amelioration in terms of   aerodynamics, the important engine cooling system, the air intake system   and brakes. The airflow and the section of the variable geometry air   intakes of the engine and the rear spoiler (also adjustable) have been   modified.</p>
<p>Owners of the 20 examples will be able to test the performance of his or her Lamborghini in person.</p>
<h4>Perfected to the ultimate detail</h4>
<p>The   engine hood made of glass laminate with open ventilation slits offers a   glimpse of the beating heart of the twelve cylinders of the super car.   The glass also features the marked arrow angle that characterises the   design from the front to the rear spoiler. The Lamborghini designers'   love for detail is beautifully illustrated by the fuel tank lid: a small   mechanical work of art, achieved by milling a solid aluminium block.</p>
<p>The   combination lights transform the incisiveness of the design into light:   the front features the most modern light-emitting diodes alongside   Bi-Xenon headlights. Seven LEDs ensure continuous daylight while there   are a further nine diodes for the indicator and hazard lights. Another   technical innovation is found in the rear light LEDs. Because of the   high temperature in the rear low part of the car, special heatproof LEDs   are used for the indicator and hazard lights, stoplights and rear   lights with a triple arrow optical effect.</p>
<h4>A new body colour</h4>
<p>Naturally,   such a refined language of shape also demands an extraordinary colour.   For the 20 examples of the Reventón, the designers from Sant'Agata   Bolognese have created a totally new hue: Reventón, a mid opaque   green/grey without the usual shine. However, thanks to the metallic   particles, in the daylight this colour tone features surprising depth.</p>
<h4>Opaque and brilliant colours for the wheel rims</h4>
<p>This   play of opaque and lustre is also featured on the wheel rims,   especially created for the Reventón. Opaque carbon fins are screwed onto   the black aluminium spokes, not only creating a visual effect with the   precision of a surgeon's scalpel, but a turbine effect also ensures   optimum cooling for the powerful ceramic brake disks.</p>
<h4>TFT display similar to an airplane</h4>
<p>The   same innovative force applied to the exterior design characterises the   cockpit of the Reventón. Designed and created using Alcantara, carbon,   aluminium and leather that comply with the top quality standards, the   interior is inspired by the next generation cockpits: just like in   modern airplanes, the instruments comprise three TFT liquid crystal   displays with innovative display modes. At the touch of a button, the   driver can choose from two vehicle information display modes. The   instruments are housed in a structure milled from a solid aluminium   block, protected by a carbon fibre casing.</p>
<p>The G-Force-Meter is   also completely new: this display shows the dynamic drive forces,   longitudinal acceleration during acceleration and braking, as well as   transversal acceleration around bends. These forces are represented by   the movement of an indicator on a graduated 3D grid depending on the   direction and intensity of the acceleration. A similar instrument can be   found in the airplanes. Formula One teams also use a similar device to   analyse dynamic forces.</p>
<h4>Customisable instruments</h4>
<p>The   instrument on the left of the speedometer associates the number of   revolutions in the form of a luminous column with the display of the   selected gear. Finally, every Reventón is equipped with a robotised   e.gear controlled by two small levers under the steering wheel.</p>
<p>By   simply pressing a button, the driver can switch to the second,   quasi-analogical display, where the classic circular instruments,   speedometer and engine speed indicator are configured in an equally   innovative way and transformed into luminous pilot lamps with varying   colours. The G-Force-Meter naturally remains at the centre in this   display mode.</p>
<h4>Electronic system developed entirely by Lamborghini</h4>
<p>All   this is possible thanks to the fact that the entire electronic platform   of the Reventón, together with all the control devices, has been   autonomously developed by the Lamborghini experts.</p>
<p>The same process for integrating the electronic displays in the car was applied to the Lamborghini Engineering Department.</p>
<p>From   the conception of the very first radical ideas, the entire Reventón has   been developed in Sant'Agata Bolognese thanks to tight teams of   remarkably creative experts. An extremely refined and efficient process   was employed: CAD design and development, creation of the prototype in   the Prototype Department, all carried out under the constant supervision   of the Research and Development Department's technicians and testers.</p>
<h4>Atelier of creativity and high efficiency</h4>
<p>Inaugurated   in 2004, the Centro Stile is dedicated to design and characterised by a   high degree of efficiency: an &quot;atelier&quot; of creators, designers and   prototype constructors, who encapsulate the Lamborghini culture and   spirit by using their remarkable skills to create aesthetic innovation.</p>
<p>The   Centro Stile is located in a 2,900 square two-storey building. The   large pavilion houses two test floors and related production and   analysis equipment, while other rooms are set aside for the most   advanced computerised workstations for designers and a style-model   construction workshop. The Centro Stile is also closely linked to the   nearby Engineering Department: the direct line between the Lamborghini   development departments guarantees that ideas rapidly become reality.</p>
<h4>Creativity and production under the same roof</h4>
<p>The   Lamborghini Reventón is a practical illustration of the streamlined   functionality and efficiency characterising the Centro Stile: it took   less than a year to progress from the first ideas to the finished car.   The complete design process from the first sketches on paper, to three   dimensional computer models with 1:10 or 1:4 scale, right up to the real   size prototype is organised around streamlined, fast, efficient work   groups. Thanks to the Centro Stile, for the first time in its history,   Lamborghini is now able to create its own style philosophy in-house   without having to rely on any external collaboration.</p>
<p>The 20 units   will be manufactured in Sant'Agata, using a production process   characterised by artisan perfection and rigorous quality standards.</p>
<h4>A masterpiece with tested technology</h4>
<p>The   technology found in the Murciélago LP640 has not been modified. The   engine in the LP640 forwards is the classic twelve-cylinder engine with   6.5 litre displacement. Only for this car, Lamborghini guarantees, an   astounding 650 HP (478 kW) at 8,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The   huge torque, equal to maximum 660 Nm, ensures a powerful switch from any   number of revolutions: even the slightest pressure on the accelerator   is spontaneously transformed into thrust. The robotised e.gear changes   gear faster than even the most expert driver. In addition, the permanent   Viscous Traction four-wheel drive system ensures that every force is   constantly translated into movement.</p>
<p>As in the original Murciélago   LP640, the Reventón accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds,   with a maximum speed over 340 km/h.</p>
<h4>Born to become a legend</h4>
<p>Since   its foundation, Lamborghini has been a creator of trends in the world   of sports cars and has always manufactured cars with an absolutely   unmistakable character. Models such as the Miura or Countach, for   example, were veritable forerunners and rapidly acquired the status of   timeless classic cars. From the moment they are launched, every new   Lamborghini promises to become a legend, destined to become a   sought-after and precious possession.</p>
<p>With the Lamborghini   Reventón, Lamborghini has done it again; it has created an unequalled   super car; the perfect synthesis between the exclusivity and appeal of a   limited edition design masterpiece, and the dynamism and driveability   of a standard sports car. Thus, the Lamborghini legend is further   enhanced by another, stylish future classic.</p>
