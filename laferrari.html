<p>  The wraps are finally off the LaFerrari. The Prancing Horse's eagerly-anticipated limited-series special, of which just 499 will be built, made its world debut at the 2013 Geneva International Motor Show.
</p>
<p>"We chose to call this model LaFerrari," declared Ferrari's President, Luca di Montezemolo, "because it is the maximum expression of what defines our company - excellence. Excellence in terms of technological innovation, performance, visionary styling and the sheer thrill of driving. Aimed at our collectors, this is a truly extraordinary car which encompasses advanced solutions that, in the future, will find their way onto the rest of the range, and it represents the benchmark for the entire automotive industry. LaFerrari is the finest expression of our company's unique, unparalleled engineering and design know-how, including that acquired in Formula 1."
</p>
<p>For Ferrari the development of a limited-series special like the LaFerrari represents an opportunity to experiment with all the technological solutions that will later filter down onto the production cars. Of particular significance in this context is the introduction of the hybrid system which, making full use of the Scuderia Ferrari's F1 KERS know-how, has resulted in a solution that exalts Ferrari's fundamental values - performance and driving thrills. The hybrid technology used, known as HY-KERS, represents the perfect combination of maximum performance and lower emissions. LaFerrari in fact emits just 330 g/km of CO2 but without resorting to electric-only drive which would not fit the mission of this model. The HY-KERS system is, however, designed so that in future applications a car can be driven using exclusively electric power for a few kilometres and, during development testing, a full-electric version of LaFerrari achieved just 220 g/km of C02 emissions on the combined cycle.
</p>  
<p>The LaFerrari is equipped with dynamic controls that are integrated   for the first time ever on a Ferrari road car with active aerodynamics   and the HY-KERS system. Thanks to Ferrari's proprietary logic which   govern all the systems, the car can achieve absolute levels of   performance, aerodynamic efficiency and handling without any form of   compromise in any area. A very advanced and uncompromising approach was   also taken with the interior design which features an HMI inspired by F1   single-seaters.</p>
<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>The   LaFerrari's architecture posed the first challenge for the Prancing   Horse team at the planning stage of the design. The aim was to achieve   ideal weight distribution (59% at the rear) and a compact wheelbase   despite the extra bulk of the hybrid system. The result is that all of   the masses are situated between the car's two axles and as close as   possible to the floor to lower its centre of gravity (by 35 millimetres)   and thereby guarantee dynamic handling and compact dimensions.</p>
<p>The   layout of the cabin made a significant contribution in this regard. The   seat is fixed and tailored to the driver while both the pedal box and   steering wheel are adjustable. The driving position is similar to that   of a single-seater and was designed after consultation with the Scuderia   Ferrari drivers, Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, who played an active   role throughout the entire development process.</p>
<p>The LaFerrari's   chassis features no less than four different types of carbon-fibre, all   hand-laminated and autoclave-cured in the racing department using the   same design and production methods as the Formula 1 car. This helped   optimise the design: various functions were integrated (e.g. seats and   battery compartment) into the chassis to improve torsional rigidity   (+27%) and beam stiffness (+22%) whilst cutting weight.</p>
<h4>Powertrain</h4>
<p>The   LaFerrari is the first car in Ferrari history to be powered by the   HY-KERS system. The ICE represents the pinnacle of engine development   and research, with a 6262 cc V12 that punches out 800 CV and revs to a   maximum of 9,250 rpm, a record for an engine of this displacement. It   also features a very high 13.5:1 compression ratio and a high specific   output equal to 128 CV per litre. The engine is coupled with a 120 Kw   (163 CV) electric motor, giving it a combined power output of 963 CV.</p>
<p>The   high torque levels available at low revs from the electric motor   allowed the engineers to optimise the internal combustion engine's   performance at higher revs, thus providing a constant supply of   exceptional power throughout the rev range. Total torque generated is in   excess of 900 Nm. The hybrid system is composed of two electric motors   developed in collaboration with Magneti Marelli - one powering the   driven wheels and the second the ancillaries - and a battery pack   attached to the floor of the chassis consisting of cells that are   assembled in the Scuderia Ferrari department where the KERS for the F138   is also made. The Scuderia's expertise allowed considerable savings in   weight and size of the individual components and the batteries weigh   just 60 kg while providing the highest energy density possible for this   kind of application.</p>
<p>The batteries are charged in different ways:   under braking (even hard braking with the ABS active) and every time the   V12 produces more torque than required, such as in cornering. In the   latter instance, rather than the being sent to the wheels, the excess   torque is converted to energy and stored in the batteries.</p>
<p>The   electric motor is coupled with the F1 dual-clutch gearbox to the benefit   of optimal weight distribution, but also to boosting energy efficiency   as torque is instantly available to the wheels and, vice versa, from the   wheels to the electric motor in recharging.</p>
<h4>Aerodynamics</h4>
<p>Active   aerodynamics play an essential role, as they allow a complete   adjustability of the car's configuration to attain LaFerrari's   exceptional performance.</p>
<p>The engineers' aim was to deliver the   highest degree of aerodynamic efficiency ever achieved with any road   car, with a coefficient of nearly 3, thanks to technical solutions honed   with CFD analysis and fine-tuned in the F1 Wind Tunnel.</p>
<p>To boost   efficiency, the LaFerrari sports active aerodynamic devices front   (diffusers and guide vane on the underbody) and rear (diffusers and rear   spoiler) which generate downforce when needed without compromising the   car's overall drag coefficient. These devices deploy automatically on   the basis of a number of different performance parameters which are   monitored in real time by the car's dynamic vehicle controls, thus   guaranteeing the ideal configuration on the basis of the driving   conditions.</p>
<h4>Control systems</h4>
<p>One further   innovative aspect of the LaFerrari is the integration of its active   aerodynamics and hybrid system with the other dynamic control systems   aboard. This means the car responds intelligently to driver inputs,   making for a seamless blend of unprecedented performance and   unparalleled driving emotions.</p>
<p>Proprietary Ferrari algorithms   deliver optimal integration of the electric motor and V12 for   instantaneous response. In cornering, for instance, the HY-KERS keeps   the V12's revs high to guarantee better acceleration on exit.</p>
<p>The   LaFerrari's Brembo braking system is also integrated with the hybrid   system, and incorporates several new features, including new lightweight   callipers designed to guarantee correct cooling and carbon-ceramic   material (CCM) discs featuring a new composition.</p>
<p>The car's   extreme performance potential called for a different tyre set-up, with   265/30 R 19 Pirelli P-Zeros on the front and 345/30 R 20s on the rear.</p>
<p>All   in all the car guarantees maximum driving thrills in every situation   and performance levels are top level: 0-100 km/h in less than 3 seconds   and 0-200 km/h in under 7 seconds, a lap time at Fiorano of under 1'20&quot; -   5 seconds faster than the Enzo and over 3 seconds faster than the <a href="f12.html">F12 berlinetta.</a> LaFerrari is thus the fastest road car in Maranello's long history.</p>
<p>Styling   The Ferrari design team led by Flavio Manzoni developed the LaFerrari's   styling working in close synergy with the engineers to emphasise the   exacting link between form and function. The result is an extreme,   innovative design which retains close links to the marque's tradition.   This is most evident in its side profile: the car has a sharp,   downward-sloping nose and a very low bonnet which emphasises its   muscular wheelarches, a clear nod to the gloriously exuberant forms of   late-1960s Ferrari sports prototypes.</p>
<p>The LaFerrari's body has   been given a sculptural treatment heavily influenced by its clearly   F1-inspired aerodynamics and a tail section that exudes uncompromising   sportiness.</p>
<p>Inside there's a newly-designed steering wheel   sporting all the major commands, and the gear-shift paddles are now   longer and more ergonomic. The signature bridge on which the F1 gearbox   functions are clustered has taken on a sleek, suspended wing-like shape.   The whole interior, in fact, has a fiercely track-inspired, pared-back   allure.</p>
