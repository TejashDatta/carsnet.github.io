<p>The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren 722 Edition displays thoroughbred motor-racing attributes, having been developed in close cooperation with the motorsport specialists at the headquarters of the McLaren Formula-1 team in England. Featuring more than 300 modified components, the super sports car serves up a boost in output, more dynamic chassis tuning, improved aerodynamics and distinctly sporty interior appointments to thrill even the most demanding of sports-car enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>For Mercedes-Benz, "SLR 722 Edition" was an obvious name for the new model variant as it evokes memories of the unforgettable victory achieved in 1955 by the British motor-racing legend Stirling Moss and his co-pilot Dennis Jenkinson at Mille Miglia - the classic Italian endurance race - behind the wheel of a Mercedes Benz 300 SLR with start number 722 (denoting the car's start time of 7.22 a.m.). Boasting an impressive output of 478 kW/650 hp, the SLR McLaren 722 Edition super sports car not only out-performs its historic forefather, it even outstrips the scintillating peak performance of the current SLR model - a technical masterstroke on the part of the engineers at Mercedes-Benz and McLaren. The new limited-edition series - only 150 models are being produced, for the most part hand-crafted, at McLaren in Woking - is the brand's response to calls from highly discerning SLR customers for even more sportiness combined with the same high level of everyday practicality.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition is a 5.5-litre V8   supercharged powerplant assembled by hand at the Mercedes-AMG engine   workshops in Affalterbach, Germany, based on the &quot;One man, one engine&quot;   principle. Among the high-performance powerplant's major strengths are   its extremely spontaneous response to accelerator pedal movements,   dynamic torque build-up across the entire engine speed range and an   unmistakable V8 sound.</p>
<p>Further modifications were made to   influence the interplay of the engine with the gearshift. For each of   the individually selectable transmission modes - M (Manual) and S   (Sport) on the one hand and C (Comfort) on the other - there is now a   different accelerator pedal characteristic curve which has been   optimised in line with the very different operating conditions that   apply in each case.</p>
<p>The end result is an extremely impressive set   of performance figures, even by high-end super sports car standards: the   Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition completes the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h   in a breathtaking 3.6 seconds (SLR 3.8 seconds), going on to achieve 200   km/h in just 10.2 seconds (SLR 10.6 seconds) and 300 km/h in a mere   28.0 seconds (SLR 28.8 seconds). Plus the top speed of 337 km/h is even   higher than that of the current SLR (334 km/h).</p>
<h4>New chassis set-up for further enhanced handling dynamics</h4>
<p>One   of the main driving forces behind the further improved performance of   the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition is the retuned chassis. Development   work at McLaren's Formula-1 headquarters was based on the SLR's proven   aluminium chassis set-up. In the first phase of development, various   chassis parameters, such as springing and damping, underwent a series of   tests on the Formula-1 dynamometer in Woking. Then the Mercedes-Benz   and McLaren engineers made further refinements and finalised the new   set-up by performing an extensive series of tests on the road and, above   all, on the race track. The stiffer spring rates and shock-absorber   characteristics of the chassis (body lowered by 10 mm at both the front   and rear) are what gives the SLR 722 Edition its increased directional   stability and noticeably further enhanced handling dynamics. Body roll   on bends has been reduced by over 20 percent, allowing the SLR 722   Edition to corner at even greater speeds.</p>
<p>New 19-inch   forged-aluminium wheels also improve the handling dynamics of the   special-edition model, their unique, palladium grey design highlighting   the car's motor-racing heritage. Their low weight, compared to ordinary   tires, reduces the unsprung masses, making the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722   Edition even more responsive. Plus the 19-inch wheels allow larger brake   discs with a diameter of 390 mm to be fitted on the front axle. Hailing   from the Italian manufacturer &quot;Brembo&quot;, the new braking system combines   with the carbon fibre-reinforced ceramic discs to provide a highly   impressive deceleration rate which is fully in keeping with the SLR 722   Edition's scintillating all-round performance. Extensive tests were   carried out to develop a new ESP® control system for this new brake   configuration.</p>
<h4>An aerodynamic work of art: even more downforce and an improved cd figure</h4>
<p>Around   100 hours of meticulous work in the wind tunnel also helped boost the   performance of the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition. Here the developers   performed yet another technical masterstroke by increasing downforce   whilst at the same time reducing the Cd (drag coefficient) figure. At   higher speeds, lower aerodynamic drag generally means lower   downforce.Not so in the case of the SLR 722 Edition though, which has an   &quot;airsplitter&quot; at its front end. Consisting of carbon with a clear-coat   finish, the distinctively shaped spoiler lip not only enhances   aerodynamics, it also increases the downforce on the front axle by 128   percent. Small wheel spoilers, also finished in carbon, reduce air swirl   at the rear axle, making for smoother airflow and optimising road feel.   If the 13-percent increase in rear-end downforce is also added into the   equation, the SLR 722 Edition provides 122 kg total downforce. In the   35° high-downforce position of the airbrake, the total downforce is   increased by another 50 kg. The result: an even more reliable handling   and more precise turn-in at high speeds.</p>
<p>In addition, the   rear-mounted airbrake optimises directional stability and braking power.   When the speed exceeds 120 km/h, it rises up at an angle that has been   adjusted in line with the extremely dynamic performance of the new   model. If the driver hits the brakes hard in an emergency, the airbrake   is automatically raised. This dynamic modification increases rear-axle   downforce within a fraction of a second, thus partially compensating for   the dynamic axle load distribution during braking, which has a tendency   to press towards the front axle.</p>
<p>A further factor which   contributes to the distinctly sports-oriented configuration is the   weight of the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition, which the engineers have   reduced by around 44 kg. A lighter oil tank and damper bodies made from   aluminium, which have the added benefit of improving the vibration   response of the unsprung masses, make for less weight. Furthermore,   various parts and components have been replaced by carbon, including in   the footwell and at the rear wheel arches. Last but not least, optimised   panelling and insulating materials also have a positive effect on the   vehicle weight. Yet for all these measures, the high levels of comfort,   safety and practicality that have become Mercedes hallmarks remain   unaffected.</p>
<p>The complete performance package at the heart of the   SLR 722 Edition really comes into its own when matched with a sporty   driving style. This is when the true benefits of the improved cornering   ability, the higher lateral acceleration and the even more agile   handling really make themselves felt.</p>
<h4>Sporty design through and through</h4>
<p>In   terms of exterior design, the Mercedes-Benz SLR 722 Edition features   discreet sporty touches, thereby satisfying the desires of keen   gentleman drivers and affluent sports-car collectors - the core target   group - to the letter. The new-look 19-inch light-alloy wheels afford an   uninterrupted view of the red-painted brake callipers and the large   brake discs, emphasising the sheer power and performance that underpins   every aspect of the SLR. In addition, individual components in carbon   with a clear-coat finish highlight the close ties with Formula 1. Plus   the grille-style design of the black-painted air outlets on the bonnet,   not to mention the palladium grey-trimmed front- and tail-light   clusters, blend in perfectly with the carbon-fibre look. The SLR 722   Edition is available with a crystal antimony grey paint finish which   creates a vivid impression of depth and produces an extremely   intensive-looking surface structure.</p>
<p>Moving inside, the sports   bucket seats, upholstered in a combination of semi-aniline leather and   Alcantara, offer excellent lateral support, while the colour contrast   provided by the distinctive &quot;300-SL-red&quot; stitching throughout the   interior, the 722 insignia on the head restraints and the red seat belts   is designed to deliver maximum appeal. The attractive material mix   comprising semi-aniline leather and Alcantara, which gives the interior   its characteristic look and feel, also features prominently on the roof   lining and door panels. Frequently used controls, such as the shift   lever and handbrake lever, are trimmed in easy-grip, moisture-absorbing   suede. The sporty design philosophy that underpins the Mercedes-Benz SLR   722 Edition is also reflected by the widespread use of carbon   throughout the interior. This material, straight from the world of   Formula 1, lends the centre console an extremely puristic look.</p>
<p>The   new-look instrument cluster focuses the driver's attention on the key   vehicle data, featuring classic-style dials with a signal-red   background. Plus the practicality of the multifunction display is   augmented by an extremely sporty touch in the shape of the AMG   RACETIMER. Finally the designers paid special attention to the steering   wheel as the key link between driver and car: with its combined   leather/suede trim, the rim is extremely easy to grip and helps to   driver to remain master of the situation when driving at high speed.</p>
