    <p>The all-aluminium Jaguar F-Type Coupé - the most dynamically capable,   performance-focused sports car that Jaguar has ever produced - is   available in three versions: F-Type R, F-Type S and the F-Type.</p>
    <p>The   range-topping Jaguar F-Type R Coupé is powered by Jaguar's 5.0-litre   supercharged V8 engine in 550PS/680Nm tune, delivering acceleration to   60mph in 4.0-seconds, and a top speed of 186mph (electronically   limited).</p>
    <p>The F-Type S Coupé and F-Type Coupé are powered by   Jaguar's 3.0-litre V6 supercharged petrol engines in 380PS/460Nm and   340PS/450Nm forms respectively, giving 0-60mph in 4.8/5.1-seconds and   top speeds of 171/161mph.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar F-Type Coupé embodies the   uncompromised design vision of the stunning Jaguar C-X16 concept sports   coupé that debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, its dramatic   cabin-rearward stance being defined by three heartlines. The first two   heartlines - shared with F-Type Convertible - form the muscular front and rear wings, the third heartline being the   sweeping Coupé roof profile which provides an unbroken silhouette while   emphasising the visual drama of the tapered cabin sitting between   powerful rear haunches.</p>
    <p>&quot;The F-Type Coupé provides its driver with   a unique sports car experience. It combines seductive design with   cutting-edge technology and performance which is truly breathtaking.   Engaging, precise, intuitive and alive - it is the definitive sports   Coupé.&quot;- Phil Popham, Group Marketing Director, Jaguar Land Rover.</p>
    <p>Jaguar's expertise in aluminium technology has enabled the design   vision for the F-Type Coupé to be delivered in a lightweight yet   extremely strong bodyshell. Torsional rigidity for all F-Type Coupé   variants is 33,000 Nm/degree - greater than in any previous production   Jaguar - this rigidity providing the basis for excellent dynamic   attributes.</p>
    <p>The F-Type Coupé's body side is made from a   single-piece aluminium pressing, probably the most extreme cold-formed   aluminium body side in the automotive industry, eliminating the   requirement for multiple panels and cosmetic joints. The roof panel   itself is available in either aluminium or panoramic glass form. A   deployable rear spoiler sits within the tapered shut-line of the F-Type   Coupé, while slim, wrap-around LED lamps flank a beautifully engineered   tailgate, with optional powered open/close functionality.</p>
    <p>To   deliver assured, progressive handling in line with its 550PS output, the   range-topping Jaguar F-Type R Coupé features a bespoke suspension   set-up and new dynamic technologies. These include a second-generation   Electronic Active Differential (EAD) and - for the first time on a   Jaguar - Torque Vectoring by braking, these systems working in parallel   to provide immediacy of response and exploitable handling. The EAD   system automatically redistributes engine torque between the rear wheels   to ensure excellent on-the-limit control, while Torque Vectoring by   braking intelligently applies precisely metered braking force to the   inner wheels as necessary during cornering to enhance agility. Sports   suspension with Adaptive Dynamics damping and Configurable Dynamic Mode   further enhance the F-Type R's immediacy of response, providing an   exhilarating and involving driving experience.</p>
    <p>F-Type R and F-Type   S Coupé models also have the option of Carbon Ceramic Matrix (CCM)   brakes which offer absolute consistency of performance and excellent   fade resistance, as well as a total unsprung-weight saving of 21kg.</p>
    <p>Every   F-Type Coupé model utilises Jaguar's eight-speed close-ratio Quickshift   transmission which is optimised for sporting performance, with full   manual sequential control from the central SportShift selector or   steering wheel-mounted paddles.</p>
    <p>The F-Type Coupé range complements   the existing three-car F-Type Convertible model line-up; the V6-engined   F-Type (340PS) and F-Type S (380PS), and the 495PS F-Type V8 S.</p>
    <h4>DESIGN AND STRUCTURE</h4>
    <p>Visual   appeal is fundamental to Jaguar and, as such, the F-Type Coupé is   immediately recognisable, building on the design of the stunning C-X16   concept sports Coupé and the F-Type Convertible - winner of the 2013   'World Car Design of the Year' award.</p>
    <p>&quot;Creating a sports Coupé is   the purest of design tasks, and also the most challenging; get it right   and aesthetically the result will be as dynamic as the car should be   rewarding to drive. In F-Type Coupé, I believe we've got it right. The   purity of the C-X16 concept has been retained without compromise; the   F-Type Coupé's long bonnet, low roofline and tapering cabin inspire me   every time I see it.&quot; Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar</p>
    <p>The   F-Type Coupé visual message is defined by three key 'heartlines', that   visual message beginning with the formidable grille. It is from the twin   'shark gill' openings that sit either side of the grille that the   essential first heartline - which mirrors the design of the F-Type   Convertible - flows and begins to take shape. Running up through the   headlamp, and accentuated by the LED 'J blade' daylight running lamps,   the line then arcs up over the front wheelarch before dropping elegantly   as it runs through the door, washing out into the muscular rear haunch.</p>
    <p>The   Coupé's second heartline, also shared with the Convertible, begins at   the rear edge of the door, swelling outwards and upwards to create a   visually strong wheelarch, emphasising the car's rear-wheel drive   layout, before dropping vertically through the tail lamp.</p>
    <p>The   third heartline forms the Coupé's dramatic, cabin-rearward, sweeping   roof profile. Providing an unbroken silhouette, it highlights the visual   drama of the tapered cabin nestled between the powerful rear haunches.   The distinctive side window graphic, finished as standard in bright   aluminium, accentuates both the compactness of the car and the roof   profile.</p>
    <p>Jaguar's expertise in aluminium vehicle architecture has   been essential in enabling both the F-Type Coupé's uncompromised design   aesthetic, while delivering the fundamental dynamic attributes -   essential to any sports car - of low mass and an extremely rigid body.   Measuring 33,000 Nm/degree, the F-Type Coupé is the most torsionally   rigid production car Jaguar has ever built.</p>
    <p>A fundamental   requirement for excellent dynamic attributes, delivering that rigidity   figure required some innovative engineering solutions in order to   maximise strength without impacting on the design vision. Due to the   lack of B-pillars, Jaguar's engineers were presented with the challenge   of keeping the design's sleek, pillarless, low roofline - combined with   the need to create the optimum amount of interior space - while still   achieving the necessary rigidity and strength targets. The solution was a   high-strength, hydro-formed aluminium alloy beam which runs from the   front of the A-pillar through to the back of the D-pillar, through the   door opening line and back to the rear quarter window.</p>
    <p>The F-Type   Coupé is available with either aluminium or panoramic glass roof panels   that are bonded into the main roof structure - torsional rigidity is   identical regardless of which roof is fitted.</p>
    <p>The F-Type Coupé's   dramatic body sides are single-piece aluminium pressings - probably the   most extreme cold-formed aluminium body side outer panels in the   automotive industry. These exceptionally deep-draw aluminium pressings   have totally eliminated the requirement for joints in the panel surface.   The body side panel is fabricated from high-strength and formable AC600   aluminium, which has also been used for structural reinforcement - both   engineering firsts for Jaguar. The use of AC300 T61 aluminium in the   body structure of the car provides additional strength thanks to its   energy absorbing properties, ensuring maximum occupant protection.</p>
    <p>In   order to achieve the required aesthetic at the rear of the car, the   F-Type Coupé features a hidden rear spoiler that sits within the tapered   shut-line of the tailgate, and rises at speed in order to balance front   and rear lift. The spoiler automatically rises at 70mph and lowers when   the speed drops below 50mph, reducing lift by up to 120kg.</p>
    <p>The   width of the tail is emphasised by the slim, full-LED lamps that wrap   all the way around the wings almost to the trailing edge of the rear   wheelarches. These lamps feature hidden-until-lit technology, appearing   solid until one of their functions is activated. The F-Type Coupé also   features a 'ribbon of light' LED high-mounted stop light, which is   hidden at the top of the beautifully engineered tailgate. The tailgate,   available with powered open/close functionality, is made from composite   materials, the boot-volume itself being up to 407-litres.</p>
    <p>Aluminium   forms a significant part of Jaguar's commitment to sustainability with   up to half the content of the body coming from recycled metal. In   addition, the F-Type Coupé's structure is exclusively riveted and bonded   - this manufacturing process emits up to 80% less CO2 compared to that   from welding a comparable steel structure. Jaguar is also rolling out   its closed-loop aluminium recycling system to its suppliers, ensuring   all offcuts of metal from the manufacturing process are reused.</p>
    <h4>F-TYPE R COUPE</h4>
    <p>The   Jaguar F-Type R Coupé represents the pinnacle of the F-Type range.   Powered by Jaguar's 5.0-litre supercharged petrol V8 all-aluminium   engine in 550PS and 680Nm form, the F-Type R Coupé achieves headline   figures of 0-60mph in 4.0-seconds with an electronically limited top   speed of 186mph, 50-75mph taking a mere 2.4-seconds. CO2 emissions are   259g/km.</p>
    <p>&quot;The F-Type R Coupé represents the pinnacle of Jaguar's R   Performance range - its power, performance and immediacy of response   will reward the most enthusiastic of drivers while, most importantly,   we've engineered the chassis to provide exploitable handling that   inspires confidence. It's precise, and it's fast… a true driver's car.&quot;   Mike Cross, Chief Engineer, Vehicle Integrity, Jaguar</p>
    <p>The R   Coupé's supercharged engine delivers not only exhilarating performance   but also tremendous efficiency thanks to the technologies incorporated   into it, including spray-guided direct injection (SGDI) and dual   independent variable cam timing (DIVCT). The high-pressure die-cast   lightweight aluminium block is stiffened with cast-iron liners and   cross-bolted main bearing caps, providing refinement to match its power.   The four-valve cylinder heads are constructed from high-grade, bespoke   aluminium, between them sitting the Roots-type twin vortex supercharger   fed by two intercoolers, which feature their own water-cooling circuit   to reduce the temperature of the pressurised air, thereby optimising   power and efficiency.</p>
    <p>The torsional rigidity of the Jaguar F-Type R   Coupé's aluminium structure has ensured the best possible basis for   offering the connected feel, agility and engaging driving experience   expected of a Jaguar sports car. Every response, from the steering to   the gearchange, throttle, brakes and the all-round double wishbone   suspension, has been finely honed to be accurate, involving and   immediate.</p>
    <p>The F-Type R Coupé is fitted with Jaguar's Adaptive   Dynamics system that actively controls vertical body movement, roll and   pitch rates. The system continuously monitors driver inputs and the   attitude of the car on the road, adjusting damper rates accordingly up   to 500 times a second to optimise stability. For the F-Type R, the   Adaptive Dynamics controlling software has a bespoke tune, working in   tandem with revised spring rates all-round to deliver consistent,   progressive and exploitable handling. Spring rates are increased by 4.3%   at the front and 3.7% at the rear (compared to F-Type V8 S   Convertible).</p>
    <p>Engaging Dynamic mode delivers an even more focused   driving experience thanks to enhanced body control through firmer   damping rates, increased steering weighting, faster gear changes and   sharper throttle response. In the F-Type R Coupé, Dynamic mode is   configurable as standard via the central 8in touchscreen, allowing the   driver to select and save settings according to their preference.</p>
    <p>In   addition to the fundamental suspension tune changes, the Jaguar F-Type R   Coupé features a new second-generation Electronic Active Differential   which, for the first time on a Jaguar, works in conjunction with Torque   Vectoring by braking. Together, the two systems ensure agility at all   speeds and exploitable on-the-limit handling.</p>
    <p>The F-Type R Coupé's   Electronic Active Differential (EAD) builds on the progressive handling   advantages of a mechanical limited-slip differential by intelligently   controlling the amount of driveline torque fed to each wheel. The EAD   utilises an electric motor which operates a multiplate clutch; by   rapidly and continuously analysing a range of electronic inputs it is   able to immediately vary torque transfer to each driven wheel to   maximise traction in any condition.</p>
    <p>The EAD system fitted to the   F-Type R Coupé features a highly sophisticated second-generation   controller. It continuously estimates surface friction, comparing that   to the driver's torque demand and delivering accurate locking torque as a   result. A new handling controller also means the EAD has the ability to   match the car's response more accurately with the driver's inputs   during both on-power understeer or off-power oversteer conditions.   Working in parallel with the Torque Vectoring by braking system, the   controller is capable of reacting to the ECU's torque request - ranging   from open to full locking torque - in under 200 milliseconds.</p>
    <p>Torque   Vectoring by braking - a standard feature on F-Type R Coupé - applies   finely metered braking torque individually to the inner wheels as   necessary, helping to turn the car into corners more precisely. Using   the Jaguar F-Type R Coupé's array of electronic sensors, the Torque   Vectoring system determines when corner entry speed may induce   understeer. It then calculates the level of brake force needed to   correct the car's direction and, via the ABS system, applies that   precise braking force to individual inner wheels as necessary. Torque   Vectoring by braking works at a subtle level, both correctively and   predictively, finely adjusting the trajectory of the F-Type R Coupé for   optimal handling.</p>
    <p>The F-Type R's EAD and Torque Vectoring by   braking systems - which work together with the car's Dynamic Stability   Control system - complement each other to optimise traction, cornering   ability and, most importantly, to maximise steering feel and agility.   Torque Vectoring by braking works to fine-tune trajectory around a   corner, and as the car is pushed further to its limits, there is a   natural, seamless transition to EAD.</p>
    <p>As a result, the use of   available grip is always optimised, enabling the F-Type R Coupé to carry   more speed both into, through and out of corners, while delivering   precision handling during high-speed manoeuvres.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar F-Type   R Coupé uses Jaguar's Super Performance braking system as standard.   This system features 380mm front and 376mm rear discs - with red or   black painted calipers. Brake cooling is optimised via under-body   channelling of air, the air-flow being derived through the use of   Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis.</p>
    <p>The R Coupé is also   available with optional Carbon Ceramic Matrix (CCM) brakes which offer   consistent performance and excellent fade resistance even during extreme   performance driving conditions, while retaining the precise pedal feel   of the standard system and extending disc life in everyday driving use.</p>
    <p>The   F-Type's eight-speed 'Quickshift' transmission has been recalibrated to   make the best use of the F-Type R Coupé's 550PS engine. Its eight,   closely-stacked, sporting ratios help to fully exploit the engine's rev   range and ensure that it remains within its optimal power band with   every gearchange. Manual control is available to the driver at any time,   using either the steering wheel-mounted paddles or the central   SportShift selector.</p>
    <p>The F-Type R Coupé's switchable Active Sports   Exhaust system - with its signature quad, outboard-mounted tailpipes -   takes the aural excitement delivered by the 550PS engine to new levels.   It offers an authentic, rich sound, developing to a howling crescendo as   the upper limits of the rev range are reached. The system uses   electronically controlled bypass valves in the rear section of the   exhaust which are mapped to open according to a range of parameters,   effectively altering the exhaust gas routing into a free-flowing   straight-through arrangement to both reduce back pressure and enhance   sound quality. Selecting Dynamic mode also opens the bypass valves, an   optional override button enabling further driver control of the system.</p>
    <p>The   Jaguar F-Type R Coupé's aerodynamic bodywork - gloss black front vanes   beneath the shark gills and flat side sill extensions - aid its   stability at the very high speeds of which it is capable. As standard   the R Coupé's window finishes are highlighted in bright anodised   aluminium along the frames of the side glass, with the grille surround   and side air vents in bright chrome, while the optional Black Pack adds   gloss black window finishers, gloss black side power air vents and a   gloss black grille surround. The front splitter, side power vents, door   mirrors casings, bonnet power vents and engine cover are also available   in carbon fibre.</p>
    <p>20in 'Gyrodyne' wheels in silver finish are   standard on the F-Type R Coupé, while a dark grey and diamond-turned   version is optional. As on any F-Type specified with 20in wheels, the   F-Type R Coupé is available with optional ultra-high performance tyres   which, with a unique tread pattern, offer additional steering precision,   and increased levels of grip for the enthusiast driver.</p>
    <h4>Interior</h4>
    <p>Like   all models in the F-Type range, the R Coupé's driver-focused cabin   clearly conveys the car's pedigree and sporting prowess, through a   combination of taut, technical styling, involving interfaces and premium   materials and textures.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar F-Type R Coupé's Performance   seats have inflatable side-bolstering and prominent wings for support   during high-speed cornering. The seats are finished in premium leather,   with the 'R' logo embossed on the headrest. A pure 'Jet' interior   colourway is offered with three options of contrast stitching - Ivory,   Red or Firesand - on the instrument panels, door casings, grab-handle   highlight and cubby box. There are a further three sporting options on   the Jet seats - Ivory, Camel or Red duo-tones, each with   similarly-matched contrast stitching.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar F-Type R Coupé's   premium trim also includes leather on the instrument panel and binnacle,   armrests, door inserts and the centre console. Leather or Suedecloth   headlinings are optional. The driver-focused cockpit conveys its   sporting intentions with a small-diameter, flat-bottomed steering wheel   wrapped in Jet leather with the R logo. A round wheel is a no-cost   option.</p>
    <p>A new, full leather and Suedecloth Jet interior (with   Cirrus contrast stitch) is also optional on all derivatives. Suedecloth   is used on the seat facings, door casings, instrument binnacle pods and   headlining - and can also be combined with a Suedecloth steering wheel.</p>
    <h4>F-TYPE COUPÉ AND S COUPÉ</h4>
    <p>The   Jaguar F-Type Coupé is also available in two V6-supercharged powered   petrol variants, both driving the rear wheels through eight-speed   Quickshift transmissions; the F-Type Coupé and the F-Type S Coupé.   Featuring the same rigid yet lightweight Coupé bodyshell as the F-Type   R, and combined with a finely tuned focus on ride, handling and   performance, both the F-Type Coupé and F-Type S Coupé are true drivers'   cars.</p>
    <p>The F-Type Coupé is powered by Jaguar's 3.0-litre V6   supercharged petrol engine in 340PS/450Nm tune, and is capable of   0-60mph in 5.1-seconds with an electronically limited top speed of 161   mph. Standard features include Dynamic Mode, sports exhaust - both V6   models use twin, centrally-mounted tailpipes - sports suspension and   Jaguar's Performance Braking system (354/325mm discs front/rear) with   silver calipers. The F-Type Coupé is fitted as standard with 18in Vela   wheels, partial leather/Suedecloth sports seats and a leather steering   wheel with black paddles.</p>
    <p>The F-Type S Coupé, powered by Jaguar's   3.0-litre V6 supercharged petrol engine in 380PS/460Nm tune is capable   of 0-60mph in 4.8-seconds on its way to an electronically limited top   speed of 171 mph. It features Dynamic Mode, Dynamic Launch, Active   Sports Exhaust, sports suspension with Adaptive Dynamics, Jaguar's High   Performance Braking system (380/325mm discs front/rear) with red   calipers and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Both Jaguar's Super   Performance and CCM braking systems are optional. The F-Type S Coupé is   fitted as standard with 19in Propeller wheels, leather sports seats and   a leather steering wheel with Ignis paddles.</p>
    <p>All F-Type models -   Coupé and Convertible - are equipped with Jaguar's Intelligent   Stop/Start system which, when conditions allow, automatically shuts down   the engine when the car comes to a halt and the driver's foot is on the   brake pedal. When the brake is released, the system can restart the   engine in less time than it takes for the driver's foot to move from the   brake to the accelerator. The system offers fuel economy and emissions   benefits of up to 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The F-Type Coupé model range is   available with three audio systems, two of which come from globally   recognised British experts Meridian. These offer either 10 or 12   loudspeakers with outputs of 380W and 770W respectively. The Meridian   systems benefit from the company's huge experience in digital signal   processing to create audio reproduction that is second to none. The top   of the range offering also features Meridian's proprietary Trifield   technology, which delivers an authentic and consistent surround sound to   both occupants.</p>
    <h4>CARBON CERAMIC MATRIX BRAKES</h4>
    <p>The   F-Type R and S Coupé models have an exclusive option of Carbon Ceramic   Matrix (CCM) brakes. Vivid yellow monoblock calipers - six-piston at the   front and four-piston at the rear - grip 398mm front and 380mm rear   brake discs made from a matrix of carbon fibre and ceramic, which is   extremely hard and highly resistant to wear.</p>
    <p>The CCM system offers   consistent performance and excellent fade resistance even during   sustained extreme driving conditions, while retaining the precise pedal   feel of the standard system. Reduced wear and tear in day-to-day driving   also means extended disc life.</p>
    <p>CCM brakes offer considerable   weight savings over standard steel brakes - the overall 21kg reduction   in unsprung weight further enhancing handling dynamics. As CCM brakes   generate more surface temperature than steel brakes, open-air intakes on   the bumper and deflectors on the anti-roll bar direct increased airflow   to the braking system - the attention to detail even extending to the   use of new, heat-resistant valve caps.</p>
    <p>CCM brakes feature a   pre-fill system function that applies a low brake pressure to all four   calipers when the throttle is released - and before the brake pedal is   pressed again. The pre-fill system ensures a consistent brake pedal   feel, and is tuned for speed proportionality. This means that at higher   speeds it will give a consistently sharp, confidence-inspiring response,   while at low car park type speeds the system will provide a more   comfort-biased pedal feel.</p>
    <p>Specify CCM brakes and the F-Type R or S   Coupé will come with 20in 'Storm' wheels. As standard these are in a   satin grey anthracite finish, but an optional, forged version with gloss   black/diamond-turned finish is offered.</p>
