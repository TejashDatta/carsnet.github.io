<p>In the year of its 50th anniversary Automobili Lamborghini is presenting an extremely exclusive model at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. Only three unique units of the Lamborghini Veneno will be built and sold. Its design is consistently focused on optimum aerodynamics and cornering stability, giving the Veneno the real dynamic experience of a racing prototype, yet it is fully homologated for the road. With a maximum output of 552 kW / 750 hp, the Lamborghini Veneno accelerates from 0-100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds and the top speed for this street-legal racing car stands at 355 km/h. It is priced at three million Euros plus tax - and all three units have already been sold to customers.
</p>
<p>The Lamborghini Veneno features a twelve-cylinder power unit with a displacement of 6.5 liters, an extremely fast-shifting 7-speed ISR transmission with 5 driving modes and permanent all-wheel drive, as well as a racing chassis with pushrod suspension and horizontal spring/damper units. Above all, however, the Veneno benefits from the very special expertise that Automobili Lamborghini possesses in the development and execution of carbon-fiber materials - the complete chassis is produced as a CFRP monocoque, as is the outer skin of this extreme sports car. The inside, too, features innovative, Lamborghini-patented materials such as Forged Composite and CarbonSkin.
</p>
<p>Fully in keeping with the tradition of the brand, the name of the Veneno originates from a legendary fighting bull. Veneno is the name of one of the strongest and most aggressive fighting bulls ever. He is also famous for being one of the fastest bulls in the history of bullfighting. His name became popular in 1914, when he fatally wounded the famous torero José Sánchez Rodríguez during the bullfight in the arena Sanlúcar de Barrameda's, Andalusia, Spain.
</p>
<h4>The Design</h4>
<p>The Lamborghini Veneno brings the   aerodynamic efficiency of a racing prototype to the road. Every detail   of its form pursues a clear function - exceptional dynamics, optimum   downforce with minimal drag and perfect cooling of the high-performance   engine. Yet the Veneno is unmistakably a Lamborghini; it sticks firmly   to the consistent design philosophy of all the super sports cars from   Sant'Agata Bolognese. That includes the extreme proportions, as well as   the powerfully arrow-shaped front end and the interplay between   razor-sharp lines and precise surfaces.</p>
<p>The entire front end of   the Lamborghini Veneno has been laid out for perfect airflow and   downforce. The front end works as a large aerodynamic wing. Large   channels guide the air to the outlets in the front hood and in front of   the windshield, as well as to the front wheels. Characteristic for   Lamborghini is the Y shape of the angular headlamps that reach well into   the fenders as well as the scissor doors.</p>
<p>The division of the   fenders from the car body is a reference to the world of sport   prototypes and optimizes at the same time the aerodynamic flow. The side   line of the Veneno is therefore dominated by enormous sills and the   mighty wheel arches front and rear. Here, too, sophisticated   aerodynamics ensure perfect airflow to the large openings for engine   cooling and intake air.</p>
<p>Just like the front end, the rear of the   Lamborghini Veneno has also been optimized for underbody aerodynamics   and high speed cornering stability. The smooth underbody transitions   into a substantial diffuser framing the four sizable exhaust pipes   divided by a splitter to increase the level of downforce peak. Large   openings serve to ventilate the engine bay and manage the airflow to the   rear wing, with the only sealed area at the rear being reserved for the   license plate. The rear lights, including brake lights, indicator   lights and fog lights, pick up the Y theme as well. The engine cover   sports six wedge-shaped openings, with the focus here, too, on optimum   dissipation of heat from the engine. The engine cover extends into a   large central &quot;shark&quot; fin, which improves efficiency during braking and   rear-end stability, by delivering additional downforce at high yaw   angles and thus increasing the high-speed cornering performance.</p>
<p>The   adjustable rear wing's design is the product of Motorsport experience   and extensive aerodynamic simulation to ensure the best performance of   rear wing interaction with rear diffuser air flow.</p>
<p>The exclusive   alloy wheels measure 20 inches at the front and 21 inches at the rear   and are equipped with center mountings. Their design is also determined   by aerodynamic functionality - a carbon-fiber ring around the wheel rim   works like a turbine to deliver additional cooling air to the   carbon-ceramic brake discs.</p>
<p>The Lamborghini Veneno is painted in   an all-new, grey metallic-look color with individual parts gleaming in   the black of the visible carbon-fiber structure. The only car to display   all three colors of the Italian flag as an accent is the car shown at   Geneva, the unit which will remain property of Lamborghini. The three   cars sold to customers each feature a single color of the Italian   national flag, together a triology in green, white and red accents and   thus representing each a unique piece.</p>
<h4>The Technology</h4>
<p>The   Veneno is further proof of Automobili Lamborghini's unique competence   in CFRP-based lightweight design. A monocoque made from carbon-fiber   reinforced polymer forms the basis of the Veneno. It is largely similar   to the <a href="aventador.html" title="Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 (2012)">Aventador</a> monocoque - as are the aluminum sub-frames front and rear - although   its form has been adapted to the new design. All exterior parts are made   from CFRP. The Lamborghini Veneno meets all safety and registration   requirements worldwide, and naturally also incorporates a full   complement of safety systems from airbags through to the adapted ESP   handling system.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber dominates the interior of the   Lamborghini Veneno, too. The carbon fiber monocoque becomes visible   inside the car in the area of the central tunnel and the sills. The two   lightweight bucket seats are made from Lamborghini's patented Forged   Composite. The woven carbon-fiber CarbonSkin® is used to clad the entire   cockpit, part of the seats and the headliner. This unique material is   soaked in a very special kind of resin that stabilizes the fiber   structure, while allowing the material to remain supple. Like a hi-tech   fabric, this extremely fine-looking carbon-fiber matting fits perfectly   to any form, and it reduces weight.</p>
<p>The racing personality has   been transferred also to the instrument panel. It has been completely   redesigned and now, thanks to an aggressive graphics and to the   introduction of some additional features like the G-meter, provides all   necessary information to the driver for control of the car.</p>
<p>The   systematic, carbon-fiber, lightweight design of the Lamborghini Veneno   is not only visible, it is also evident on the scales: With a dry weight   of just 1,450 kilograms (3,190 pounds), the Veneno is even 125 kilos   (275 pounds) lighter than the already extremely lean Aventador. The   highly beneficial power-to-weight ratio of 1.93 kg/hp (4,25 lbs/hp)   guarantees a performance that is nothing short of mind-blowing. Even the   stunning acceleration figure of 2,8 seconds cannot adequately describe   it. Despite an aerodynamic setup configured for extreme downforce, the   Veneno possesses exceptionally low wind resistance which allows it to   reach a top speed of 355 km/h (221 mph).</p>
<p>The twelve-cylinder with a   displacement of 6.5 liters is a thrilling combination of absolute   high-revving frenzy and phenomenal pulling power. Its output has been   raised to 552 kW / 750 hp, facilitated through enlarged intake paths,   optimized thermodynamics, a slightly higher rated rpm and an exhaust   system with even lower back pressure. The ISR manual gearbox, permanent   all-wheel drive and pushrod suspension have all been specifically   adjusted to meet the demands of the Lamborghini Veneno.</p>
<p>The   Lamborghini Veneno celebrates its first public appearance at the 2013   Geneva Motor Show. The vehicle on show is the number 0, the Lamborghini   test vehicle. Its future has not been determined yet, but it will allow   Lamborghini to continue its activity of testing and innovation, both on   the road and on the race track. The trilogy made of three unique   vehicles will be produced in the course of the year 2013 and handed over   to their future owners.</p>
