<p>Automobili Lamborghini is taking a major step into the future: with   the newly developed Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4, the successor to the   highly successful Gallardo,   the Italian super sports car manufacturer is redefining the benchmark   in the segment. With its pure and absolute design, breathtaking dynamics   and excellent quality, the Huracán delivers an unparalleled sports car   experience. It unites mighty performance with a character perfectly   suited to everyday use; its wide-ranging new technologies work together   in a fully integrated fashion. Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of   Automobili Lamborghini said: &quot;With the Huracán, Lamborghini is writing   the next chapter in its great history.&quot;</p>
<p>With 14,022 units   produced, the Gallardo is the most successful Lamborghini model ever   made. During its ten-year production run, it took the brand into a   completely new dimension. In true Lamborghini tradition, the successor   to the Gallardo also takes its name from the world of bullfighting:   Huracán was a fighting bull of the Spanish Conte de la Patilla breed who   fought in August 1879 in Alicante. His unyielding character made him   invincible.</p>
<p>With the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4, Lamborghini is   taking its purist, unmistakable design language to a whole new   evolutionary level. The design is bold and edgy, with beautifully   sculptural forms. The starting point of the design process was the   Huracán's silhouette. The objective was to define the car with a single   line stretching from the front end over the passenger cell to the rear.   The side windows take on a hexagonal form that looks like a gem set into   the profile of the Huracán. At night, too, it is utterly unmistakable:   All lights, including the main headlamps, beam in LED technology - an   absolute first in the super sports car segment.</p>
<p>An innovative cockpit dominates the interior. The 12.3-inch TFT   display can be configured in a number of different modes and provides   the driver with all key information in a virtual format. The slender   lines of the instrument mounts and the center tunnel are indicative of   the lightness of the interior design. Fine materials distinguish the   interior, which can be extensively individualized, while the extremely   detailed craftsmanship delivers a highly refined sense of quality.</p>
<p>The   newly conceived hybrid chassis of the Huracán LP 610-4 is a technical   work of art that unites carbon-fiber and aluminum components. The   ultralight chassis forms the basis for the vehicle's low dry weight of   1,422 kilograms; with its excellent stiffness, it guarantees the   handling precision of a racing car.</p>
<p>The new V10 engine in the   Huracán generates its phenomenal propulsion from a displacement of 5.2   liters. It produces a power output of 448 kW / 610 hp at 8,250 rpm and a   maximum torque of 560 Nm at 6,500 rpm. The new &quot;Iniezione Diretta   Stratificata&quot; combines direct and indirect injection - achieving an   increase in power and torque compared with the Gallardo and a decrease   in fuel consumption and emissions.</p>
<p>With its power-to-weight ratio   of just 2.33 kilograms per hp, the Lamborghini Huracán achieves   absolutely breathtaking performance. The top speed of more than 325 km/h   and the acceleration figures - zero to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds, zero to   200 km/h in 9.9 seconds - offer an indication of its dynamics. Thanks   in part to the Stop &amp; Start technology, ECE average fuel consumption   has dropped to 12.5 liters per 100 km (290 g CO2 per km).</p>
<p>The   power generated by the ten-cylinder is delivered to the road via the new   7-speed dual-clutch transmission &quot;Lamborghini Doppia Frizione&quot; (LDF)   and an all-wheel drive that also features a new hydraulic multi-plate   clutch. Three different driving modes, spanning from road to race track,   can be selected using a drive select switch in the steering wheel. The   system is called ANIMA (Italian for Soul) - &quot;Adaptive Network   Intelligent Management&quot;, and impacts the engine, the transmission, the   all-wheel drive and the ESC handling system as well as other dynamic   systems.</p>
<p>The wheels of the Lamborghini Huracán measure 20 inches   in diameter, with the standard-fit carbon-ceramic brake system   delivering exceptional stopping power. As an option, Lamborghini offers   its new luxury super sports car with the Lamborghini Dynamic Steering   variable steering system and MagneRide electromagnetic damper control.   Both of these features are also integrated into ANIMA.</p>
<p>The   Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 celebrates its show premiere at the 2014   Geneva Motor Show, with customer delivery scheduled to start in spring   2014. The Huracán is priced at 169,500.00 Euro, excluding taxes. The   Production takes place at Automobili Lamborghini headquarters in   sant'Agata Bolognese.</p>
<h4>Exterior Design</h4>
<p>The   elegance of a Lamborghini is in the beauty of its highly concentrated   power - every line and every detail pursues the need for speed,   dynamics, performance. Design is an essential element of the Huracán LP   610-4, too - unmistakable, hermetically sealed and completely free from   ornamentation.</p>
<p>The dimensions frame the contours of a dynamic   wedge measuring 4,459 mm long, 1,924 mm wide and 1,165 mm high, with a   wheelbase of 2,620 mm. Taut curves contrast with sharp edges, which   require innovative technology in working with aluminum and carbon fiber   and with geometric surfaces. A characteristic basic form for Lamborghini   is the hexagon - visible in the front air intakes and their   three-dimensionally formed mesh inserts, in the side windows, in the   intake openings for the engine and in the standard-fit wheels in Giano   design.</p>
<p>The arrow-shaped front end of the Lamborghini Huracán   angles sharply downward like the nose of a shark, with two pleats adding   contour to the hood. The flat, angular headlamps are fitted only with   LEDs - an innovation in this class of super sports car. Light guides   produce the daytime running light, forming two Y-shaped contours in each   headlamp and giving the Huracán the look of a predator ready to pounce.   With a color temperature of 5,500 Kelvin, the LED light is very close   to that of daylight, providing excellent road illumination and putting   very little stress on the eyes. The LEDs are designed to last the   lifetime of the vehicle and are extremely energy efficient.</p>
<p>A   massive air intake, cut deep into the front end and stretching across   its full width, dominates the front of the Huracán. Fins painted in body   color cut strong diagonal lines through it. As on a race car, the lower   contours of the air intake jut forward to form a splitter.</p>
<p>The   avant-garde character of the Lamborghini design is particularly evident   from the side - the Huracán LP 610-4 is a fast-moving technical   sculpture.</p>
<p>Its aluminum cladding stretches tautly over the mighty   20-inch wheels; a single, flowing line runs from the front end over the   roof to the rear. The roof arcs slightly over the heads of the driver   and co-driver, these contours continuing onto the luggage compartment   lid and through the extremely low-lying C-pillars.</p>
<p>Starting at the   headlamp, is a line that runs over the front fender to define a broad,   angled edge on the door. Together with the flat, dropping roof arc, the   rising door edge presents a three-dimensional frame for the side windows   - which are set into the flanks like gemstones. Where these lines meet   at an acute angle is the upper intake that feeds the engine with air.</p>
<p>The   lower intake for cooling air emerges from the angular sill in front of   the wide, rear wheel arch. The absence of the large, vertical air intake   that was a feature of the Gallardo, brings athletic tension and   powerful flow to the flank of the Huracán.</p>
<p>In its standard format,   the engine cover between the extremely low-lying C-pillars consists of   three large, matte-black polymer fins in homage to the classic Miura.   Lamborghini offers an optional transparent cover that reveals a clear   view of the V10. In this version, the engine bay is clad in visible   carbon fiber, made using Lamborghini's patented Forged Composite   Technology.</p>
<p>The rear end of the Huracán also has a highly   three-dimensional form. Like the intake at the front end, the wide,   meshed outlet for ventilating the engine bay is cut deep into the rear.   Above it are the narrow rear lights, likewise fitted entirely with LEDs.   Similar to the front headlamps, their light also takes on a Y-shaped   contour. The four end pipes of the exhaust system flank a large   diffuser; its substantially dimensioned elliptical fairings are chromed   and perforated.</p>
<p>Each design detail of the Lamborghini Huracán LP   610-4 celebrates the esthetic of function; the designers from the Centro   Stile worked closely together with the aerodynamic experts. The large   air intakes at the front of the super sports car specifically direct the   cooling air and headwind to increase down pressure on the front axle.   The spoiler lip at the rear works together with the rising diffuser in   the underbody to improve airflow around the rear of the car - the   Huracán does not require a movable rear spoiler. The underbody is   completely clad, with NACA channels directing headwind to the radiators.</p>
<p>Lamborghini   offers the Huracán in 17 colors, including seven new ones. The flat   colors are Bianco Monocerus and Nero Noctis. The metallic tones come   with the names Bianco Icarus, Blu Achelous, Grigio Lynx, Grigio Nimbus,   Nero Serapis and Rosso Mars. The pearlescent shades are Arancio   Borealis, Giallo Midas and Verde Mantis. Also available from the Ad   Personam individualization program are the matte paint finishes Bianco   Canopus, Giallo Horus, Grigio Titans, Marrone Apus and Nero Nemesis. The   metallic colors from Ad Personam - Blu Caelum, Grigio Admetus and   Marrone Alcestis - complete the color palette.</p>
<h4>Bodyshell</h4>
<p>Lamborghini   rises to the next level with the Huracán LP 610-4 when it comes to the   bodyshell concept, too. The Gallardo had an aluminum space frame - an   extremely stiff framework consisting of cast nodes and extruded profile   with permanently integrated aluminum panels. Its successor features an   innovative hybrid chassis. It combines aluminum components with large   elements made from carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) - that   ultra-lightweight material in which Lamborghini has developed   groundbreaking expertise over many years.</p>
<p>The hybrid chassis of   the Lamborghini Huracán consists partly of aluminum; the front and rear   sections of the car with the axle mounts are made almost entirely from   the lightweight alloy, and carbon-fiber parts produced using the RTM   process (Resin Transfer Molding). They are concentrated around the   occupant cell, where they form part of the floor and sills, the center   tunnel, the rear bulkhead and the B-pillars with their particularly   complicated geometries. The x-shaped brace in the engine bay is also   made from CFRP. Stainless steel fasteners connect the aluminum and   carbon-fiber components.</p>
<p>The innovative hybrid chassis of the   Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 weighs less than 200 kilograms, even less   than the already very lightweight space frame of the Gallardo. The   hybrid chassis is considerably better when it comes to crash safety and   stiffness, which lays the foundation for the dynamic handling and   precise production finish. The rear bulkhead, for instance, offers   excellent protection in the event of a side impact, because its fibers   are laid out in exactly the direction of load travel.</p>
<h4>Interior</h4>
<p>The   state-of-the-art interior of the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 offers   wonderful consistency in its design, a thrillingly sporty character and   relaxing comfort for long-distance driving. The distinctive feature of   the exterior design - the sharply defined hexagonal body and surfaces -   plays a dominant role here, too. The dashboard is low-slung and features   hexagonal trim elements on its extremely slender fascia. The instrument   display and air vents look like standalone, add-on components. A   console stretches from the dashboard to the center tunnel.</p>
<p>Inside   the Huracán, the driver and co-driver enjoy more space and better   visibility than in the Lamborghini Gallardo - both are just as evident   on a trip to the race track as they are on the daily drive into work.   The low seats with their pronounced contouring and integrated backrests   provide the body with excellent grip and support. In the standard   version, they can be electrically adjusted for the angle of the backrest   and longitudinal position. Further electrical functions for seat   height, seat angle and the length of the seat cushion are available as   options.</p>
<p>The operating concept for the Lamborghini Huracán LP   610-4 is strictly focused on the driver. He/she can use the buttons on   the flat-bottomed three-spoke steering wheel to manage the many vehicle   functions, including indicators and windshield wipers; the two large   shift paddles serve to control the dual-clutch gearbox. In executing all   actions, the driver can keep eyes on the road and hands on the steering   wheel at all times.</p>
<p>Behind the steering wheel is a 12.3-inch TFT   screen with a high resolution of 1440 x 540 pixels. The virtual cockpit   presents all critical information in razor-sharp 3D graphics with   sophisticated visual effects. Working in the background is a super-fast   graphic processor, the Tegra 30 chip from the Tegra 3 Series by Nvidia.   For the rev counter, for instance, it generates 60 frames per second,   ensuring absolutely homogenous movement of the needle.</p>
<p>The driver   can switch between three display screens. In Full drive mode, the large,   central rev counter dominates the view, flanked by displays for fuel   level and water temperature. Speed is shown as a digital read-out. In   Mixed mode, the rev counter is smaller and moves to the left, with a   window for infotainment functions like the navigation map occupying the   right half of the display. In Full Navi and Infotainment mode, the map   fills most of the monitor. Regardless of the mode selected, the display   along the lower edge shows all the important warning and advisory   symbols.</p>
<p>There are further display and control elements on the   long center console, ergonomically arranged as if on a lectern. The   uppermost one is a narrow TFT display for the climate control, which can   be switched to show oil pressure, oil temperature and voltage. Beneath   it is a strip of switches for secondary functions, accompanied by   another group of switches on the left of the cockpit.</p>
<p>In the   center of the console are the controls for the automatic air   conditioning and the infotainment system. Its main control is surrounded   by buttons that provide direct access to the main menus of the   navigation, phone, info, radio, media and sound functions; a further   rotary control is for volume adjustment. Arranged horizontally on the   center tunnel are the start/stop button beneath a red flap, the   transmission buttons for neutral, park and reverse gear and the button   for the electronic parking brake. Two glove boxes, a cell-phone tray and   two door pockets accommodate the small things of everyday life.</p>
<p>The   uncompromising precision and attention to detail with which the   interior of the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 is crafted, is rooted in   the finest tradition of Italian craftsmanship and sets new benchmarks in   the league of super sports cars. Luxury materials indulge the senses   with their fine look and feel; their selection and the choice of colors   on offer are clear evidence of the fine touch and keen eye of the   Lamborghini designers. The upper area of the dashboard is clad in dark   Alcantara to avoid reflections in the windshield. LEDs provide the   interior illumination, too - there is not as single conventional bulb   anywhere on or in the car.</p>
<p>One color dominates the interior of the   Huracán - Nero Ade black. The dashboard, center console, the center   panels on the seats and the door panels are all clad as standard in soft   leather, with Alcantara setting accents on the air vents and on the   inside of the door mirrors. To complement this, customers can choose   from four interior variants. They can use these in a number of ways -   depending on the variant - to individualize the lower zone of the   dashboard, the center console, door grips, door mirrors, the center   panels of the seat backs, the air vents and the cladding on the   A-pillars and roof beams.</p>
<p>The Elegante two-tone interior comes   with a choice of nine contrasting colors and additional leather options;   the upper part of the center console gleams in high-gloss black, with   the air vents painted in matte dark gray. In the one-tone Sportivo   interior, much of the cladding is made from Alcantara in Nero Ade, while   the two-tone Sportivo interior offers Alcantara in six contrasting   colors. Alternatively, the two-tone Sportivo interior also comes with   supple nappa leather. As an option, the stitching - a total of 30 meters   - is also available in a contrasting color. The program is rounded off   by further options such as Lamborghini logos and lettering for the   interior, or foot mats with leather piping.</p>
<h4>Power Unit</h4>
<p>The   acronym LP in the model name of the Huracán LP 610-4 refers to the   orientation of the extensively redesigned V10 engine - it is mounted in   typical Lamborghini fashion longitudinally behind the driver   (&quot;longitudinale posteriore&quot;). The number 610 is the power output in hp,   which equates to 449 kW and is available at 8,250 rpm. The specific   output is no less than 86.3 kW / 117.3 hp per liter of displacement; the   torque curve reaches its peak of 560 Nm at 6,500 revs.</p>
<p>Like every   Lamborghini engine, the 5.2-liter V10 is a high-performance, naturally   aspirated unit. It captivates the driver's senses with stunning throttle   response, with gloriously free revving well over the 8,000 mark, with   amazing pulling power and with an inimitable sound that takes on new   facets as the revs rise - founded on a voluminous bass and topped by   soaring trebles.</p>
<p>The ten-cylinder catapults the Huracán LP 610-4   from a standstill to 100 km/h in just 3.2 seconds - each hp has to move a   mere 2.33 kilograms. The figure from zero to 200 km/h is 9.9 seconds,   while the top speed is on the other side of 325 km/h. Yet, the   high-performance engine makes do with an average of 12.5 liters of fuel   per 100 km, a CO2 equivalent of 290 grams per km. The improvement versus   the Gallardo LP 560-4, aided also by a Stop &amp; Start system as   standard, is 11 percent.</p>
<p>The displacement of 5,204 cm3 is the   result of an 84.5 millimeter bore and 92.8 millimeter stroke. The V10   fires alternately at 54 and 90 degrees, with 12 its forged crankshaft   conceived as a common-pin shaft. This construction, in which the conrods   of the opposing pistons run on a common crank pin, maximizes stiffness   while minimizing weight. The forged-steel conrods and the forged   aluminum pistons are likewise both extremely strong and lightweight.</p>
<p>The   crankcase is made from an aluminum-silicon alloy and is produced using a   low-pressure gravity die-casting process that guarantees a particularly   high level of homogeneity. The high silicon content makes the cylinder   barrels extremely wear resistant. A bedplate construction gives the   crankcase exceptional stiffness and optimum vibration characteristics.   The cast-iron bearing bridges reduce thermal expansion and thus minimize   play in the crankshaft main bearings.</p>
<p>The dry sump lubrication   with its separate oil tank is a classic motorsport technology. It allows   the V10 to sit very low down, while assuring it receives an adequate   supply of lubricant, even under extreme lateral acceleration. The   pressure-lubrication pump works in accordance with load, making it   highly efficient.</p>
<p>The ten cylinders are always very well filled.   Four camshafts, each of which can be adjusted through 42 degrees of   crank angle, actuate the valves via roller cam followers. Like the oil   pump and the water pump, they are driven by chains running at the back   of the engine.</p>
<p>The plenum chamber of the two-channel intake system   is made from lightweight polymer; in the intake channels are pneumatic   flaps. When the load and revs are low, they set the incoming air into a   cylindrical rotation; this tumble further increases the efficiency of   the combustion process. The exhaust system is also conceived with two   channels, with its components laid out for low back pressure. There are   flaps in the two end pipes; the vacuum formed at higher loads and revs   causes them to open, giving a fuller, deeper sound.</p>
<p>One   groundbreaking innovation of the V10 is the dual fuel injection, known   as &quot;Iniezione Diretta Stratificata&quot;. On start-up and under higher loads   and revs, a common-rail system injects fuel at a pressure of up to 180   bar directly into the combustion chambers. This results in intense   swirl, which has the effect of cooling the cylinder walls and permits a   higher compression ratio of 12.7:1. At lower loads, fuel is injected   indirectly into the manifold, which reduces fuel consumption and   particulate emissions. At medium loads and revs, both injection systems   work together. The V10 already complies with the EU6 norm.</p>
<h4>Transmission</h4>
<p>Superfast,   virtually imperceptible gearshifts without any interruption in torque -   the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 comes with a completely new   transmission. Where the Gallardo still used the e.gear automated manual   transmission, its successor features the Lamborghini Doppia Frizione   (LDF) 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. It is exceptionally efficient and its   ratios are closely set for maximum sporting performance.</p>
<p>The LDF   transmission, mounted behind the V10 at the rear of the Huracán, is   extremely compact at less than 60 centimeters long. Its control and   actuation is via a separate block, where the electronic, mechanical and   hydraulic components all work together. An oil pump supplies oil to the   gear sets, clutch and integrated differential; thermal management is   handled by an oil-to-water and an oil-to-air heat exchanger.</p>
<p>In   Lamborghini's new dual-clutch transmission, engine power flows along a   twin drive shaft and two output shafts. Two multi-plate clutches   positioned one behind the other operate two mutually independent partial   gearboxes. Clutch K1 sends the torque via a solid shaft to the gear   sets for gears 1, 3, 5 and 7. Rotating around the solid shaft is a   hollow shaft. It is connected to 14 clutch K2 and drives the gear sets   for gears 2, 4 and 6, as well as reverse gear.</p>
<p>The two partial   gearboxes are permanently active, but only one of them is connected to   the engine. When, for example, the driver is accelerating in third gear,   the second partial gearbox already has the fourth gear engaged in   preparation. The gearshift takes place through switching the clutches -   K1 opens and K2 closes in just a few hundredths of a second. The driver   can shift gears himself via the steering wheel paddles, or make use of   the fully automatic drive program. When maximum acceleration is   required, a touch of a button hands the business of engaging the clutch   at optimum engine speed over to Launch Control. It makes sure that the   engine power is delivered to the road with a perfectly regulated degree   of tire slip.</p>
<p>One classic Lamborghini strength is all-wheel drive -   for more than 20 years, it has stood for the ultimate in dynamics,   traction and stability. Back in 1993, the Diablo VT was the first Italian super sports car with four driven wheels. In the   Huracán LP 610-4, too, superior traction means that drivers can   accelerate out of corners earlier than those in rear-wheel drive   competitors - with a brand new all-wheel drive system developed from the   ground up strictly for maximum performance.</p>
<p>At the second output   shaft, the LDF transmission incorporates a connection with the prop   shaft that runs through the V10 crankcase to the front axle. There, an   electronically controlled and hydraulically actuated multi-plate clutch   handles the matter of torque distribution - marking a further step   forward compared with the viscous coupling of the Lamborghini Gallardo.   Inside is a set of plates running in an oil bath. The metal friction   rings are arranged axially in pairs - one ring in each pair is   permanently interlocked with the casing that rotates with the prop   shaft, the other with the short output shaft leading to the front axle   differential.</p>
<p>Under normal driving condition, the multi-plate   clutch diverts only around 30 percent of the engine torque to the front   wheels - meaning the Huracán has a strong rear-drive bias. However,   should traction at the rear axle diminish, the clutch can smoothly and   in a matter of seconds divert up to 50 percent of torque to the front   wheels by pushing the plate set together in a controlled manner.   However, a maximum of 100 percent of the torque can be distributed to   the rear axle. At the rear axle, a mechanical differential lock   integrated into the LDF transmission improves traction even further.</p>
<h4>Chassis</h4>
<p>Each   and every kilometer in the Huracán LP 610-4 is pure fascination,   particularly on a race track or winding country road. The super sports   car from Sant'Agata Bolognese is a driving machine with extremely high   cornering speeds and precise, virtually instantaneous reflexes. It is   consistently effortless to drive, stable and free of unpleasant   surprises.</p>
<p>Like in a race car, the mid-engine concept provides an   ideal distribution of axle load of around 42:58, and the Huracán's   chassis, too, makes use of motorsport technologies. The double wishbone   suspension at all four corners, for example, is made from forged   aluminum in order to reduce unsprung masses. Rubber/metal mounts direct   the transverse forces precisely into the bodyshell, while their   elasticity delivers good longitudinal running characteristics. Track   measures 1,668 mm at the front and 1,620 mm at the rear.</p>
<p>New   developments in the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 include the   electromechanical rack-and-pinion power steering. It delivers finely   differentiated, immediate feedback and has a direct, sporty ratio of   16.2:1. Its power assistance, which generally consumes very little   energy, decreases as speed increases. The electromechanical power   steering helps the driver when braking and countersteering on road   surfaces that are slippery on one side by supporting the right   correction.</p>
<p>Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) is available as an   option and marks a further innovation in the super sports car segment.   At its heart is a superimposed drive unit in the steering column driven   by an electric motor. The so-called strain wave gear can vary the ratio   by almost 100 percent (9:1 - 17:1). In city traffic, the LDS steering is   extremely direct, while its intentionally indirect setup at high speed   delivers supreme directional stability. At the very edge of the   cornering envelope, it minimizes understeer, as well as oversteer during   load transfer, by delivering tiny, targeted countersteering impulses.</p>
<p>Also   offered as an option is the new magneto-rheological damper control   system. Circulating in the pistons of the shock absorbers is synthetic   oil containing tiny magnetic particles. When a voltage is applied to a   coil, it generates a magnetic field. Inside this, the particles align   themselves perpendicularly to the flow of electricity and thus restrict   the flow of oil through the piston channels. A high-speed control unit   continually calculates the optimum value for each wheel. During turn-in,   for instance, it raises the damping force at the outside front wheel.   This has the effect of reducing bodyroll, and reaction becomes even more   spontaneous as a result.</p>
<p>Another innovation in the Lamborghini   Huracán is a new dynamic drive mode system. The system is called ANIMA   (Italian for Soul) - &quot;Adaptive Network Intelligent Management &quot;. Via a   button in the lower steering wheel spoke, the driver can switch a number   of different vehicle systems between the modes &quot;Strada&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot; and   &quot;Corsa&quot; - from an everyday setup, through sporty to racing. It   encompasses the throttle valves, the sound flaps in the exhaust, the LDF   7-speed dual-clutch transmission, the all-wheel drive, the ESC   stability control and the LDS as well as the magneto-rheological   dampers.</p>
<p>The Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 runs in its standard   format on silver 20-inch alloy wheels; their &quot;Giano&quot; design is inspired   by the classic Lamborghini trademark of five large holes. The tires -   245/30 at the front and 305/30 at the rear - are from the Pirelli P Zero   range and were developed specifically for the Huracán. Even lighter are   the optional &quot;Mimas&quot; wheels featuring a twin-spoke design and also   measuring 20 inches - they are made using flow-forming technology.</p>
<p>Behind   the big wheels are potent brakes come as standard with carbonceramic   technology. All four discs are internally ventilated and perforated,   their cooling channels quickly dissipating the heat. The front discs   measure 380 millimeters, the rear 356 millimeters. Ten elements fasten   the friction ring to an aluminum carrier, which forms the connection to   the wheel hub - a concept from motorsport.</p>
<p>The high-end discs are   virtually fade-free, extremely robust and offer exceptional performance   paired with excellent longevity; together, they weigh considerably less   than equivalent steel brake discs - the number of kilograms measuring in   double figures. The calipers - with six pistons at the front and four   at the back - are painted silver and bear Lamborghini lettering. They   are also optionally available in yellow, black, red and orange.   Furthermore, the Huracán is equipped with an electric parking brake.</p>
<p>The   Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 uses a brand new electronics platform. One   particular focal point of the development process was the integration   of the ESC electronic stability control, which receives and sends all   data at incredibly high speeds. In the dynamic system's &quot;Sport&quot; and   &quot;Corsa&quot; modes, ESC provides an increase in lateral dynamics. For a fast   lap on the track, the driver can completely deactivate the system.</p>
<p>The   Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale is a system for precise and direct   measurements of the vehicle movements (X, Y, Z accelerations, Roll,   Pitch, Yaw rates). It consists of several on-board sensors: 3   accelerometers + 3 gyroscopes precisely placed on the center of gravity   of the car and provides real-time high-speed communication via a FlexRay   CAN-bus to ESC, 4WD, LMR, LDS.</p>
<p>The result are fast and responsive   vehicle dynamics as well as maximized vehicle performances. The system   is derived from aeronautics and for the first time applied in a series   production car.</p>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>The new super   sports car from Sant'Agata Bolognese leaves the factory with an   exceptionally high level of standard equipment. It encompasses a host of   high-end technologies including the Iniezione Diretta Stratificata dual   injection, the stop &amp; start system, the 7-speed dual-clutch   transmission Lamborghini Doppia Frizione and the all-wheel drive with   the new electrohydraulic multi-plate clutch. In the carbon-ceramic brake   discs and the new ANIMA dynamic drive mode system the Huracán offers   two more first-class features.</p>
<p>All light functions are fulfilled   by LEDs - from the LED headlamps to the interior lighting. The seats are   equipped with electric backrest adjustment, while the electric exterior   mirrors have a fold-in function. Automatic climate control is also   standard, as is tinted glass all around. Two front airbags and   head/thorax airbags protect the driver and co-driver in the event of an   accident, with belt tensioners completing the package.</p>
<p>Further   standard equipment features in the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 are the   versatile multi-function steering wheel, the shift paddles for the LDF   transmission and the 12.3-inch display, which presents all key   instruments in a range of virtual views. The Lamborghini Infotainment   system is also standard and includes a radio with CD/DVD drive, an audio   interface and six speakers.</p>
<p>The interior of the super sports car   comes as standard in Nero Ade black with soft leather and Alcantara.   Customers can also choose from a number of additional variants - the   two-tone &quot;Elegante&quot; interior, the one and twotone &quot;Sportivo&quot; interior   and the two-tone &quot;Sportivo&quot; interior with nappa leather. Following   market launch, Lamborghini will expand the Ad Personam program -   alongside exclusive colors and yarns, it offers a host of additional   features for making the car as individual as its owner's fingerprints.</p>
<p>The   equipment list for the Huracán includes further comfort options: an   optical parking assistant front and rear - which can be enhanced with a   reversing camera - fully electrically adjustable heated seats and an   armrest. In the field of infotainment, Lamborghini offers a navigation   system with extremely detailed 3D graphics, a Bluetooth interface and a   digital radio tuner.</p>
<p>For the exterior, there is a transparent   engine cover together with engine bay cladding in carbon fiber. Optional   wheels in Mimas design also set powerful accents. The LDS steering   system with its variable ratio and MagneRide electromagnetic damping   make the already extremely dynamic handling just that little bit more   thrilling. The tire pressure warning display rounds off the range of   chassis options.</p>
