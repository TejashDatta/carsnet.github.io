    <p>Twenty-five years after the debut of the original, paradigm-shifting   NSX supercar, Acura revealed the production version of its highly   anticipated successor—the next-generation Acura NSX, developed and   produced in the U.S.—to the world's auto media at the 2015 North   American International Auto Show. The production model, in a   scintillating NSX Red finish, took the stage with a growl from its   twin-turbocharged engine.</p>
    <p>The next generation NSX showcases the   production styling, design and specifications of Acura's mid-engine   sports hybrid supercar, and Acura announced key details of the all-new   vehicle's design and performance. The company will begin accepting   custom orders for the new NSX starting in the summer, with customer   deliveries expected later in the year.</p>
    <p>Specifically created to   bring a &quot;new sports experience&quot; to the supercar segment, the NSX   challenges conventional beliefs about supercars — much as the first   generation did a quarter century ago. The approach is realized through   an all-new power unit—a twin-turbocharged 75-degree DOHC V6 engine with a   9-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT) and three-electric motor Sport   Hybrid system—integrated with an ultra-rigid and lightweight   multi-material body with world's-first material applications and   manufacturing processes. Developed under the concept of a   &quot;human-centered supercar,&quot; a car that puts the driver first in every   aspect of its design, the next-generation NSX will leverage its   state-of-the-art hybrid supercar power unit, body and chassis to deliver   exceptionally intuitive and immediate response to driver inputs.</p>
    <p>&quot;Our commitment was to create an all-new NSX that is true to the   heritage of NSX—a supercar that delivers a new driving experience, one   where every part of the vehicle is respectful of the smartest part of   the car, the driver,&quot; said Mike Accavitti, senior vice president and   general manager of the Acura division. &quot;The soul of a car is the   emotional connection it makes with the driver. With the NSX, that   connection will be intense and immediate.&quot;</p>
    <p>As the pinnacle   representation of Acura performance and prestige, the NSX was introduced   at the auto show under the theme of &quot;Precision Crafted Performance.&quot;   The theme was the original tagline for the Acura brand, a guiding force   behind the development of the original NSX and a critical component of   its launch.</p>
    <p>The development of next-generation NSX, driven by   precision crafted performance, has resulted in a clean-sheet design,   which involved nearly three years of intensive development effort by a   global design and engineering team led by engineers at the company's   development center in Raymond, Ohio.</p>
    <p>&quot;The NSX reflects Acura's   American roots and makes a powerful statement about the strong role   being played by our North American operations in envisioning and   building the future of Acura,&quot; said Erik Berkman, executive vice   president of the Acura Business Planning Office. &quot;Our global team   embraced the challenge to create a new sports car experience, leveraging   new technology to deliver incredibly vivid performance in a vehicle   that responds intuitively and immediately to the will of the driver,&quot;   said Ted Klaus, chief engineer and global development leader of the new   NSX. &quot;The NSX delivers pinnacle supercar performance, with zero-delay   acceleration and exhilarating, confidence-inspiring driving dynamics.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The   new NSX is a product of what we term 'Interwoven Dynamic' design,&quot; said   Michelle Christensen, NSX exterior design project leader. &quot;It   represents the ideal blending of exotic sports car form and supercar   function.&quot;</p>
    <p>The NSX body features classic low and wide proportions   married to modern and alluring surfacing, an aggressive front design,   and tail lights that pays homage to the original NSX. The signature side   intake and floating C-pillar collects air to feed the mid-mounted   engine and directs airflow over the rear deck to increase downforce. To   accommodate the new longitudinally mounted twin-turbo V6 and 9-speed   DCT, the production vehicle was lengthened (+3 inches) and widened (+1   inch) with a slightly more cab-forward package, compared with the   proportions of the NSX Concept shown in 2012.</p>
    <p>Every element of the   exterior body design has been carefully fashioned for total airflow   management for both stability-enhancing downforce and vehicle systems   cooling. The NSX has undergone extensive testing at the company's   state-of-the-art wind tunnel in Raymond, Ohio, leading to a number of   significant changes from concept to final body design, including   modified hood vents, new front fender vents, modified side air intakes,   and an optimized deck spoiler.</p>
    <p>&quot;Consistent with the   'human-centered supercar' development concept, the NSX was designed from   the inside out with an uncompromising focus on the driver,&quot; said   Johnathan Norman, NSX interior design project leader. &quot;Like the original   NSX, we created a 'Human Support Cockpit' that provides exceptional   driver control, visibility and packaging, but further advanced to meet   the extreme performance expectations of a modern supercar.&quot;</p>
    <p>The   NSX interior boasts exceptional forward visibility, simple and intuitive   controls, and class-leading ergonomics—most notably the seat, which   features top-class holding performance with outstanding comfort and easy   ingress/egress.</p>
    <p>The NSX's instrument cluster features a dynamic   TFT display that responds to changes in the driver-selectable Integrated   Dynamics System with pertinent graphics and information. The center   console holds the Power button that readies the sport hybrid powertrain,   nested in the center of the new Integrated Dynamics System dial   control. Interwoven under the handcrafted leather dash panel is the   exposed midframe—a functioning chassis structural member that reflects   the design aesthetic of a naked sport bike. An ultra-thin, yet super   strong A-pillar design and low-mounted instrument panel minimize   obstructions to the driver's view of the road.</p>
    <p>In keeping with the   foundational philosophy of the original NSX, the next-generation NSX is   designed to provide a new sports car experience that maximizes the   capabilities of the driver, delivering exceptionally intuitive and   confidence-inspiring response &quot;at the will of the driver.&quot;</p>
    <p>Acura   engineers leveraged the company's expertise both with high-performance   engine and hybrid electric-drive technologies, as well as its two   decades of experience with industry-leading dynamic torque-vectoring   technologies, including Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), to   create the most sophisticated, technologically advanced and intelligent   powertrain in the supercar universe.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the NSX's   performance capabilities is an all-new mid-mounted, 75-degree, DOHC V6   engine with twin turbochargers mated to an Acura-developed 9-speed DCT.   The V6 engine employs a race-inspired compact valve train and dry sump   lubrication system to help lower the center of gravity. The all-new   9-speed DCT delivers synapse-quick gear changes and rev-matching   downshifts. The rear direct-drive electric motor, housed between the   engine and transmission, supports acceleration, braking and transmission   shifting performance. The NSX's front wheels are driven by twin   independent high-output electric motors which deliver instantaneous   torque response and dynamic left-to-right torque distribution.</p>
    <p>The   NSX uses its front electric motors for dynamic torque vectoring in   addition to enhancing acceleration and braking performance. The result   is an instantaneous &quot;zero delay&quot; launch performance and handling   response that seems to anticipate the driver's desire. The NSX has   undergone extensive testing at some of the world's most challenging race   circuits, including the famed Nurburgring.</p>
    <p>Also in keeping with   the legacy of NSX—the world's first all-aluminum supercar—the new NSX   features an innovative new multi-material body design with world's-first   material applications and construction processes.</p>
    <p>The NSX body   utilizes a space frame design—an internal frame constructed of aluminum,   ultra-high strength steel and other advanced materials. Anchored by a   carbon fiber floor, torsional and bending forces are taken up entirely   by this ultra-rigid structure which also utilizes advanced joining   technologies.</p>
    <p>The NSX features world's-first casting technology   that combines the design and manufacturing flexibility of a casting   process with the strength and elongation properties of a forged   material, enabling significant weight reduction. The body panels are   composed of a combination of aluminum and sheet molding composite (SMC).</p>
    <p>The   NSX features an &quot;Advanced Sports Package&quot; with placement of key   powertrain components -the mid-mounted engine, twin front motors and   Sport Hybrid battery pack and power control unit - optimized to   concentrate vehicle mass low and toward the center of the vehicle, to   further enhance dynamic response.  The combination of this packaging   concept and the lightweight body give the NSX the lowest center of   gravity in its class.</p>
    <p>The NSX utilizes a fully independent,   all-aluminum front and rear suspension and puts its considerable power   down through ContiSportContact™ high-performance tires—245/35Z R19 front   and 295/30Z R20 rear—mounted on 19x8.5 inch front and 20x11 inch rear   aluminum alloy wheels. Powerful, natural and confident braking   performance is provided by 6-piston front and 4-piston rear monoblock   calipers squeezing ultra-high performance carbon-ceramic brake discs.</p>
    <p>Handling   is greatly enhanced by Sport Hybrid Super-Handling All Wheel Drive   (Sport Hybrid SH-AWD), enabling lightning-quick response to all driver   inputs—steering, braking and throttle—along with the stability, control   and launch performance of all-wheel drive. Agile Handling Assist (AHA)   uses the subtle application of brake torque to further enhance yaw   response and dynamic stability.</p>
    <p>The NSX's dial-operated Integrated   Dynamic System features Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track modes. The   system adjusts engine, motor, transmission and chassis response, as well   as the engine sound level, based on the needs of the driver and driving   environment. Quiet mode enables electric-only driving at lower speeds   for short durations. Dynamic vehicle responses become increasingly sharp   as the driver moves from Sport to Sport+ mode and, finally, to Track   mode, where the NSX reveals the full spectrum of its performance   capabilities.</p>
    <p>The NSX also features a &quot;launch&quot; function to achieve   the ultimate in &quot;zero delay&quot; launch performance, aided by both the   engine and three electric motors.</p>
    <p>The NSX will be manufactured   exclusively at the Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) in Marysville,   Ohio, where approximately 100 highly-skilled associates will conduct   full body construction, paint, and final assembly using domestic and   globally-sourced parts.</p>
    <p>The PMC and its processes have been   developed to perfectly blend associate craftsmanship and technology in a   new approach to manufacturing. By in-housing the body construction,   Acura maintains complete control over total body quality, including   critical strength, suspension accuracy, and fit and finish—from initial   construction all the way to final assembly.</p>
    <p>Associates will   utilize innovative techniques to deliver next-generation craftsmanship   and world-class quality in the realm of specialized, supercar vehicle   production.</p>
