<p> The Jaguar XK was the first car created entirely under the aegis of Design Director Ian Callum. Dramatic and purposeful, yet as sensuous as only a Jaguar can be, the XK now receives a number of revisions that reinforce its contemporary, assertive character.
</p>
<p>The latest lighting technology has allowed the front headlamps to be made slimmer and at the same time incorporate LED signal functions and running lights. Combined with a larger grille and new bumper design, this gives the XK instant 'rear-view mirror' recognition. Unmistakably a Jaguar, each model in the range gains unique styling attributes that distinguish it from its siblings. Chrome mesh grilles on the XK are replaced with matt black detailing on the XKR while the flagship XKR-S receives a unique front bumper underlining its sense of purpose.
</p>
<p>The power vent along the front wing has been altered from a vertical to horizontal design with a mesh insert. Emblazoned with the Jaguar name, it serves to emphasise the potential inherent in the XK's design. To the rear, the boot lid has been revised with a slimmer chrome finisher which allows the car to be graced by the famous Jaguar 'leaper', bringing it into line with the rest of the company's products.
</p>
<p>Complementing the design changes are 17 paint colours, five of which are new and a range of alloy wheels that now total 11 different designs ranging in size from 18 to 20 inches. A further opportunity for owners to express their individuality is available through the 'Black Pack', now also available as an option on the naturally aspirated cars as well as the Jaguar XKR. This replaces exterior chrome with a matt black finish, complemented by 20-inch gloss black alloy wheels. On the Jaguar XKR, the package also includes body coloured aerodynamic enhancements and optional side graphics.
</p>
<h4>XK Powertrain and Dynamics</h4>
<p>Jaguar sports cars   have a reputation for blending athletic high-performance with effortless   cruising comfort. Nothing exemplifies this dual character more clearly   than the XK's 5.0-litre AJ-V8 engine.</p>
<p>Now in its third generation   this offers not only tremendous power but also great efficiency by   incorporating the very latest technology including spray-guided direct   injection (SGDI) and dual independent variable cam timing (DIVCT). Like   the car itself, the engine is constructed from high-grade, lightweight   aluminium, which in the cylinder heads is recycled to reduce the   environmental impact of manufacture.</p>
<h4>New 186mph XKR-S</h4>
<p>Available   in both naturally aspirated and supercharged forms from the beginning,   the engine is now offered in a third variant in the XKR-S. Based on the   supercharged unit in the Jaguar XKR, revised fuel mapping and an active   exhaust have boosted power and torque to 550PS and 680Nm respectively,   creating the most powerful Jaguar road car ever. This allows the car to   reach 60mph in just 4.2 seconds and join the exclusive '300km/h' club   with a limited top speed of 186mph. Not only extremely powerful but also   efficient, the XKR-S emits just 292g/km of CO2.</p>
<p>All variants of   the XK use the six-speed ZF automatic gearbox with steering   wheel-mounted paddles to control the Jaguar Sequential Shift function   for greater driver control. In the XKR-S the transmission has been   revised in line with the increased power and torque to optimise upshifts   and allow for the increased top speed.</p>
<p>The XK's exhilarating   driving dynamics are the result of the latest generation of Jaguar's   Adaptive Dynamics technology that provides a continuous and seamlessly   variable damping strategy to negate the traditional trade-off between   ride comfort and handling.</p>
<h4>Luxury and performance duality</h4>
<p>Adaptive   Dynamics performs three main functions; controlling vertical body   movement, roll and pitch rates. One hundred times every second, Adaptive   Dynamics analyses the thousands of inputs and variables which determine   ride and handling characteristics. By also monitoring wheel position   500 times every second, the system is able to achieve the famous Jaguar   duality between comfort and sporting appeal. Should the driver wish to   alter these characteristics, there is the option of Dynamic Mode, which   increases body control, sharpens throttle response and reduces gearshift   times.</p>
<p>The two supercharged variants of the XK also benefit from   Jaguar's Active Differential Control technology. This uses a multiplate   clutch to vector torque to the driven wheel with the most grip. Allied   to the ABS and stability control, this allows for the ultimate in   traction and precision both mid-corner and at its exit. Non-supercharged   models use a mechanical differential, which delivers outstanding levels   of grip and stability under power.</p>
<p>All models benefit from the   Dynamic Stability Control system which offers four modes: normal,   Winter, TracDSC and DSC Off, allowing the enthusiastic driver to choose   the level of intervention dependent on road conditions.</p>
<p>The XKR-S   model enhances both these electronic systems and the inherent stiffness   of the lightweight aluminium architecture to create the most dynamic and   exciting Jaguar yet.</p>
<h4>Uprated suspension</h4>
<p>The   double wishbone front suspension has been comprehensively revised with a   new fully-machined steering knuckle. This significantly increases   camber and castor stiffness by 0.13 degrees per kilonewton to transform   the accuracy and weighting of the steering for greater levels of   connection, feedback and precision. Rear suspension geometry has been   revised with rear wheel steer optimised for maximum agility while spring   rates have been increased at both ends of the car by 28 percent.</p>
<p>The   Active Differential has been programmed to reduce steering sensitivity   at the very high speeds of which the car is capable, increasing   stability and driver control. Bespoke software for Jaguar's Adaptive   Damping has been written for the XKR-S, ensuring both total body control   and maximum traction and grip. Changes to the TracDSC mode alters   intervention levels to allow the experienced driver to explore the outer   edges of the performance envelope, rewarded by the motorsport inspired   soundtrack from the exhaust, which features an active pneumatic valve.</p>
<p>The suspension changes and Performance exhaust system are available as part of the Dynamic Pack option for the Jaguar XKR model.</p>
<p>&quot;The   XKR-S encompasses everything a performance Jaguar should be; as   capable, precise and thrilling on your drive home as it is at the   Nürburgring. Every response delay has been minimised in order to give   the car a more connected feel in the manner in which it steers, handles,   stops and goes.&quot; Mike Cross, Chief Engineer, Vehicle Integrity</p>
<h4>XK Interior</h4>
<p>The   dual nature of the XK is apparent from the moment the driver enters the   cabin. Luxurious and cocooning, the sporting potential is apparent from   the moment the Start button pulses red. Pressing it fires the engine   into life with a deep, musical reverberation and the Jaguar   DriveSelector rises from the centre console as a point of first contact   to begin the process of bonding man with machine.</p>
<p>In the latest   XK, the cabin has been refreshed with a host of new trim materials   including ebony soft-feel paint for the switches, gloss black finish to   the centre console and phosphor blue halo illumination and ambient   lighting. New veneers, colour combinations and headlining options allow   owners to create a cabin ambience precisely matching their requirements.</p>
<p>A   new leather-wrapped, multi-function steering wheel has also been added,   providing a tactile interface between car and driver, complemented on   the XKR-S by 'Jaguar' embossed stainless steel pedals, which are   optional on other models.</p>
<h4>New performance interiors</h4>
<p>Standard   on the XKR-S and optional on the XKR and XK Portfolio models are the   new Performance front seats. Featuring integrated head restraints and   increased lateral and squab support, the new seats hold driver and   passenger securely and comfortably in place. The 16-way adjustment of   squab, cushion, lumbar and bolster elements is supplemented by memory   and heating functions. Unique to the XKR-S is a Carbon patterned and   soft-grain leather interior with contrasting micro-piping and stitching.   The Jet Poltrona Frau Italian leather headlining that is standard on   the XKR-S is offered as an option on other models.</p>
<p>The central   seven-inch Touch-screen provides an intuitive interface for the   extensive technology that is seamlessly incorporated into the XK,   including iPod and USB connectivity and satellite navigation with DVD   mapping. The central screen also projects the image from the new reverse   parking camera.</p>
