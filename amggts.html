    <p>The first Mercedes was a racing car, its most recent successor   carries this heritage forward: with the new Mercedes-AMG GT, the   Mercedes-AMG sports car brand is moving into a new, top-class sports car   segment for the company. The GT is the second sports car developed   entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG. Its front mid-engine concept with   transaxle and the intelligent aluminium lightweight construction form   the basis for a highly dynamic driving experience. Its likewise newly   developed AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine underscores the hallmark AMG   driving performance. The first sports car engine with internally mounted   turbochargers ('hot inside V') and dry sump lubrication is configured   in two output ratings: as a GT with 462 hp and as a GT S with 510 hp.   The new GT combines driving dynamics and first-class racetrack   performance with superb everyday practicality, and efficiency that sets   new standards in the segment.</p>
    <p>It has everything you would expect   from an authentic Mercedes-AMG sports car - from the characteristic   styling, thoroughbred motorsport technology to the optimum weight   distribution. The drive system tailored consistently to driving dynamics   perfectly complements this set-up. The centrepiece of the Mercedes-AMG   GT, the new 4.0-litre V8 biturbo, responds instantly with extreme power   right from low revs and delivers outstanding performance.</p>
    <p>Top   figures such as 3.8 seconds from zero to 62 mph and a top speed of 193   mph, combined with the outstanding driving dynamics will undoubtedly   translate into extremely fast laps on the racetrack.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the two-seater is a straightforward, comfortable   and reliable companion for everyday motoring thanks to its practical   tailgate, easily accessible luggage compartment, high level of comfort   on long journeys and the extensive Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive   assistance systems.</p>
    <p>&quot;With the new Mercedes-AMG GT, we are   venturing out into a challenging sports car segment with its top-class   competitive field. This is an incentive and motivation for us at the   same time to prove to sports car enthusiasts around the world the kind   of performance that AMG is capable of,&quot; says Prof Dr Thomas Weber,   Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Group   Research &amp; Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.</p>
    <p>&quot;With the new GT we   are positioning Mercedes-AMG even more aggressively than to date as a   dynamic sports car brand,&quot; says Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.   &quot;With its technological substance, the Mercedes-AMG GT fulfils our high   aspirations with regard to driving dynamics, agility and sportiness. The   new GT is the second sports car developed fully independently by   Mercedes-AMG. The car is manufactured according to the motto   'Handcrafted by Racers' - which perfectly encapsulates our heritage and   our spirit.&quot;</p>
    <p>The combination of aluminium spaceframe, V8 biturbo   engine with dry sump lubrication, seven-speed dual clutch transmission   in transaxle configuration at the rear axle, locking differential,   sports suspension with aluminium double-wishbone suspension and the low   kerb weight of 1540 kilogrammes delivers racetrack performance. The   concept with front mid-engine and transmission in transaxle   configuration makes for a beneficial weight distribution of 47 to 53   percent between the front and rear axle. In conjunction with the   vehicle's low centre of gravity this translates into extremely agile   handling and permits high cornering speeds. With a favourable   power-to-weight ratio of 3.3 kilogrammes per hp, the Mercedes-AMG GT   self-confidently lines up alongside the very best in its segment. The   sports car also sets a new benchmark figure for fuel economy: fuel   consumption of 30.4 mpg (NEDC combined) constitutes a considerable   increase in efficiency.</p>
    <h4>Exterior design: sporty emotion and sensual purity</h4>
    <p>&quot;The   new Mercedes-AMG GT is a sports car in its purist form,&quot; says Gorden   Wagener, Vice President Design Daimler AG. &quot;Breathtaking proportions,   powerfully sculpted surfaces and flowing lines turn the new AMG into a   contemporary sports car which embodies the spirit of the glorious   Mercedes sports cars. The GT is a consummate combination of beauty and   intelligence.&quot;</p>
    <p>The new Mercedes-AMG GT embodies the sensual purity   of sportiness and emotion. The two-seater is characterised by hallmark   rear-wheel-drive proportions. The V8 biturbo front mid-engine ensures   optimum weight distribution, which forms the basis for superb driving   dynamics. The long bonnet with its pronounced powerdomes, the greenhouse   which has been moved far back, the large wheels and broad tail end make   up the distinctive looks. The large tailgate conceals a practical   luggage compartment.</p>
    <h4>Muscular and dramatic dynamism</h4>
    <p>Positively   arched surfaces give the Mercedes-AMG GT its sensuous character and the   appearance of a sculpture. Viewed from the side, the dome-shaped,   arched roof line and the frameless doors are eye-catching features. A   muscular element sculpted out of the side wall creates a sense of   lightness and dynamism, even when the vehicle is at a standstill. The   surfaces and lines of the side wall flow into the rear-end with a   dramatic tapered effect. The GT deliberately avoids lines in the   shoulder region. The only line is one lower down, picked up again in the   rear bumper, which stretches the body and makes it appear lighter. The   side air outlets, each with two fins, represent a typical, styling   feature of Mercedes-Benz sports cars. The GT has no visible aerials   which could disrupt the overall appearance.</p>
    <p>The creative   interaction of diverse design elements lends the coupé a superior,   self-confident front: the three-dimensional diamond radiator grille with   central Mercedes star, a broad louvre and AMG lettering stands in the   centre of the front end. LED High Performance headlamps with stylised   &quot;eyebrows&quot; as daytime running lamps, side lights and indicators, as well   as three separate high-beam reflectors lend the GT its characteristic   look.</p>
    <p>Large air intakes optimise the flow of air to the cooling   modules. The A-wing with front splitter in the lower third of the front   apron, a characteristic feature of AMG vehicles, makes the sports car   appear low-slung and wide. While the front splitter is painted in the   body colour on the GT, it comes with a high-gloss black finish on the GT   S. Overall, customers can accentuate the exterior design according to   their personal preferences: options available include the Exterior   Silver Chrome package, the Night package and the Exterior Carbon-Fibre   package.</p>
    <h4>Broad shoulders for an emotional overall appearance</h4>
    <p>With   its base areas, broad shoulders and narrow tail light graphics, the   rear area creates an emotional overall appearance. The licence plate   bracket is located in the lower part of the bumper, allowing the   Mercedes star to be placed prominently on the smooth-surfaced boot lid.   Added to which is an extendable rear aerofoil, which is concealed from   view while the car is at a standstill. The black diffuser insert with   tailpipes integrated into the bumper and the trim strip in matt iridium   silver inspired by the A-wing in the front create a visual sense of   lightness across the entire tail end.</p>
    <p>Flat, wide tail lights with   new sequential turn signals reflect state-of-the-art technology. 18   individual LEDs on each side indicate where the driver intends to turn   by sequentially illuminating them from the inside to the outside.</p>
    <p>The   tail lights underline both the sporty styling of the rear, as well as   the attention to detail and sophistication - form and function combine   in a unique way to create a perfect unit.</p>
    <h4>Interior: sensuality, emotion and perfection</h4>
    <p>The   interior design also embodies maximum emotion and sensual purity.   Radically low, sporty proportions create a unique sense of spaciousness.   Clearly drawn components and their authentic materials underscore the   dynamic character and create instant excitement: Anyone opening the door   discovers an exciting interplay between the deep, sloping dashboard and   a dominant, arched high centre console, a design which evokes emotions   and impresses with its perfection.</p>
    <p>The central &quot;aviation design&quot;   theme, which is the hallmark of Mercedes-Benz sports cars, has been   restyled. The extreme emphasis on the width of the dashboard, which   creates an impression of a powerful wing, dominates the cockpit of the   GT. Four central spotlight-style vents and the individual vents at the   right and left ends of the dashboard reinforce this impression. In   conjunction with the high beltlines, the concave-shaped door panelling   and the dynamic centre console, the GT comes across as a genuine driving   machine and consummately integrates the driver into the cockpit thanks   to the low seat position.</p>
    <p>The dominant centre console appears to   be a feature lifted straight from motor racing by virtue of its styling   that is reminiscent of a NACA air intake, as well as the surfaces and   authentic materials that have been used - there is a choice of silver   chrome, matt carbon fibre, high-gloss carbon fibre, black diamond and   matt silver fibreglass. Positioned centrally, the free-standing central   display is an eye-catching feature. Attention to detail is also echoed   in the AMG DRIVE UNIT controls: they are arranged like eight cylinders   in a V layout, emphasising the powerful and high-tech impression made by   the centre console.</p>
    <p>Outstanding precision and a superior quality   feel thanks to the finest materials with superb workmanship are also   apparent on the sports seats, the performance steering wheel and the   instrument cluster. The most important control for sports car fans is   located in the AMG DRIVE: the button for starting the engine, which is   labelled &quot;Engine Start Stop&quot; and illuminated in red.</p>
    <h4>The newly developed AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine</h4>
    <p>The   new high-performance engine springs to life at the push of a button:   even the sound as the engine starts up brings you out in goose pimples.   The 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine was developed specifically for the GT.   The innovative eight-cylinder engine as the newest member of the   BlueDIRECT engine family boasts outstanding power delivery, performance   figures on a par with motor racing, lightweight construction as well as   high efficiency and environmental compatibility. It boasts the brand's   hallmark emotive V8 engine sound, along with an immediate response and   high pulling power.</p>
    <p>The new V8 also stands out with its precise   power output, which is easily a match for a naturally aspirated engine.   The driver truly appreciates the AMG engine, with its internal   designation M178, particularly in M, or Race mode in the selectable   drive modes, thanks to its linear power delivery, which makes it much   easier to handle the vehicle at the limits. As part of this process, the   sophisticated ECU even factors in the current driving condition and   adjusts the accelerator response depending on the lateral forces   generated.</p>
    <p>With a displacement of 3982 cc, the V8 uses a range of   technologies which are already being used in the 2.0-litre turbo engine   in the A 45 AMG, CLA 45 AMG and GLA 45 AMG - presently the most   powerful, series-production four-cylinder engine in the world. Both   engines have the same bore/stroke ratio, providing the basis for high   revving ability. The piezo direct petrol injection used at Mercedes-Benz   is responsible for the mixture formation. The spray-guided combustion   process was further developed in the third generation to meet all future   legal requirements. The highly efficient and economical AMG 4.0-litre   V8 biturbo engine meets the Euro 6 emissions standard, including the   maximum particulate emissions level that takes effect in 2016.</p>
    <h4>First sports car engine with 'hot inside V' and dry sump lubrication</h4>
    <p>The   new AMG V8 engine has two turbochargers which are not mounted on the   outside of the cylinder banks but rather inside the V configuration -   experts call it a &quot;hot inside V&quot;. The benefits are a compact engine   design, an optimum response from the turbochargers and low exhaust gas   emissions thanks to optimum air flow for the close-coupled catalytic   converters. The dry sump lubrication also ensures the oil supply even   with high lateral forces and allows the engine to be installed lower,   thus moving the centre of gravity closer to the road and forming the   basis for high lateral acceleration.</p>
    <p>The new Mercedes-AMG V8 biturbo engine is the world's first sports car engine with 'hot inside V' and dry sump lubrication.</p>
    <h4>Performance exhaust system with fully variable exhaust flaps</h4>
    <p>The   Mercedes-AMG GT S is equipped as standard with an AMG performance   exhaust system with fully variable exhaust flaps. This allows the driver   to vary the engine sound: depending on the selected DYNAMIC SELECT mode   the driver may experience the V8 with a focus on comfort and relaxed,   long-distance journeys or with a more powerful, emotive,   motorsport-inspired touch. The AMG DRIVE UNIT includes a separate button   to control the exhaust flaps directly. The new Mercedes-AMG sports car   has its own tonal characteristics which denote the car's membership of   the AMG family but that also distinguish it clearly from other   high-performance cars. The selectable exhaust system is also available   as an option for the Mercedes-AMG GT.</p>
    <h4>A tradition of hand-built excellence: &quot;one man, one engine&quot;</h4>
    <p>The   4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine is being made in Affalterbach according to   the &quot;one man, one engine&quot; principle. In the AMG engine shop, highly   qualified fitters assemble the engines by hand according to the   strictest quality standards - visible on the AMG engine plate with the   engine technician's signature. &quot;One man, one engine&quot; ties in with   Mercedes-AMG's unique motorsport genes, which exude innovative strength   by virtue of the technology transfer from the racing series - from   Formula 1, the DTM to the involvement in customer racing with the SLS   AMG GT3.</p>
    <h4>Seven-speed dual clutch transmission in transaxle configuration</h4>
    <p>When   it comes to the power transmission of the new GT the Mercedes-AMG   engineers rely on a combination of front mid-engine and seven-speed dual   clutch transmission in transaxle configuration at the rear axle - this   layout has already successfully established itself in the SLS AMG. The   weight distribution with its ratio of 47 per cent (front) to 53 per cent   (rear) benefits from this configuration. The efficiency, shift speed   and precision of the AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7-speed sports transmission were   further optimised for usage in the new sports car. Thanks to the larger   gear ratio spread, the pronounced torque plateau of the V8 turbo engine   can be used optimally.</p>
    <p>The drivetrain's overall design is ideal   for an uncompromising sports car. At the same time, the exacting   requirements in terms of everyday practicality, noise level, ride   comfort and fuel consumption have been met.</p>
    <p>To transfer the   driver's shift commands even more directly, communication between the   engine and transmission has been fundamentally revised. This means that   the previous limits of shift performance and the response time have been   substantially increased. The driver can individually tailor the GT to   their wishes with the aid of AMG DYNAMIC SELECT. Various modes are   available: &quot;C&quot; (Controlled Efficiency), &quot;S&quot; (Sport), &quot;S+&quot; (Sport Plus)   and - entirely new - &quot;I&quot; (Individual). The manual &quot;RACE&quot; drive program   reserved exclusively for the GT S optimally adjusts the shift strategy   of the dual clutch transmission to the needs of racetrack usage -   including faster shift speeds and a highly emotive engine. By pressing   the &quot;M&quot; button, the driver can activate the manual transmission mode in   any drive mode.</p>
    <h4>Electronic rear-axle locking differential as standard in the GT S</h4>
    <p>The   GT comes as standard with a mechanical rear-axle locking differential   which ensures outstanding traction and superb driving safety in all   driving conditions. The GT S is fitted as standard with an   electronically controlled rear-axle locking differential, which is   integrated into the compact transmission housing. The electronic   function provides even more sensitive, faster control than the   mechanical solution, thus pushing the limits of handling dynamics even   further. Not only does it further improve the traction of the driven   wheels, but also increases the cornering speeds at the limits. The   system operates with a variable locking effect in acceleration and   overrun mode, and is perfectly tuned to the various driving conditions   and road surface friction coefficients.</p>
    <h4>Double-wishbone suspension from motorsport</h4>
    <p>Driving   dynamics and comfort on long journeys; racetrack performance and   everyday practicality: the new Mercedes-AMG GT delivers on all counts. A   great deal of attention was paid to the seamless integration of all   mechanical and electronic systems during the design, development and   testing. Whether it is the suspension, 3-stage ESP®, locking   differential, steering, aerodynamics, tyres or brakes - only the   successful precision engineering and concerted networking of individual   specialist disciplines manage to produce the required results and thus   the exhilarating sports car driving experience, characterised by superb   precision and clear feedback.</p>
    <p>The AMG GT offers the perfect   conditions: it uses the technological DNA of the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG,   one of the most successful sports cars in recent years. Thanks to the   optimum weight distribution of 47 percent (front) to 53 percent (rear),   the vehicle's low centre of gravity and the selected suspension layout,   the driver benefits from precise steering response, formidable agility,   low inertia when changing direction, and outstanding traction.   Double-wishbone suspension is used at the front and rear - a technology   adopted straight from motorsport.</p>
    <p>Wishbones, steering knuckles and   hub carriers on the front and rear axle are manufactured entirely out   of forged aluminium in order to reduce the unsprung masses. The   double-wishbone concept locates the wheel clearly with minimal elastic   movements. The high camber and track rigidity not only results in high   cornering speeds, but also provides the driver with an optimum road feel   when cornering at the limit. An extremely direct connection of the   shock absorber on the rear hub carrier reduces vibrations and   undesirable wheel load fluctuations. Highly neutral behaviour and   defined, predictable responses at the tyre grip limit were important   development objectives for the dynamic handling experts at Mercedes-AMG.</p>
    <h4>Mercedes-AMG GT S with electronically controlled damping</h4>
    <p>The   AMG RIDE CONTROL sports suspension with electronically controlled   damping comes as standard on the Mercedes-AMG GT S, or as an option for   the GT. The driver can adjust the damping characteristics at the push of   a button in the AMG DRIVE UNIT or by using the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive   modes. Three stages are available: &quot;Comfort&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Sport plus&quot;.</p>
    <p>The   speed-sensitive sports steering features a variable steering ratio: it   enhances vehicle handling and agility at low speeds while maintaining   driving safety at high speeds. The power assistance is a particular   highlight: it not only responds depending on road speed, but also on the   current lateral acceleration and the selected AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive   mode. As a result, the driver has a perfect feel for the vehicle thanks   to the direct feedback from the road. The standard-fit 3-stage ESP® with   the &quot;ESP ON&quot;, &quot;ESP SPORT Handling Mode&quot; and &quot;ESP OFF&quot; functions works   in perfect unison with the locking differential and is tuned optimally   to the outstanding driving dynamics and safety.</p>
    <h4>AMG DYNAMIC PLUS package available as an option for the GT S</h4>
    <p>The   Mercedes-AMG GT comes as standard with drivetrain damping. A specially   tuned damper reduces undesirable rolling motion of the entire drivetrain   including the transaxle transmission, thus substantially improving   comfort and agility.</p>
    <p>The AMG DYNAMIC PLUS package augments   dynamism and agility even more. It is available exclusively for the GT S   and includes dynamic engine and transmission mounts. The engine and   transmission mounts assume an important function in the case of a   transaxle design: soft mounts improve comfort since they provide more   effective decoupling of noise and vibration. Handling and agility   benefit, however, from an overall stiffer mount set-up.</p>
    <p>Mercedes-AMG   resolves these conflicting objectives using dynamic mounts, which   adjust their stiffness continuously, and instantly to the respective   driving conditions and handling. The special control electronics in the   AMG CHASSIS CONTROLLER, ACC, provide this function. The ACC detects   driving situations on the basis of CAN data, is connected to the   electronic rear-axle locking differential and thus ensures optimum,   balanced driving dynamics. AMG has gone a step further when implementing   this technology: the engine and transmission mounts are even actuated   independently of each other. The advantage: this innovative solution   provides an additional substantial improvement in driving precision and   lateral dynamics.</p>
    <p>Jochen Hermann, Head of Overall Vehicle   Engineering AMG: &quot;The combination of selectively variable mounts and a   transaxle drivetrain is unique. Mercedes-AMG is once again promoting   leading-edge technology, thus affirming our aspirations in terms of   driving performance.&quot;</p>
    <p>A specific engine application in the DYNAMIC   SELECT &quot;RACE&quot; drive mode and in the manual &quot;M&quot; transmission mode makes   the GT S even more dynamic. The package also includes tauter suspension   tuning thanks to raised spring and damping characteristics, more   negative camber at the front axle as well as an adapted sports   speed-sensitive steering. Thus the driver benefits from better   performance with optimised handling. The performance steering wheel as   well as yellow highlights in the instrument cluster round off the AMG   DYNAMIC PLUS package.</p>
    <h4>Optional ceramic high-performance composite brake system</h4>
    <p>Excellent   deceleration characteristics and high fade resistance come courtesy of   the high-performance composite brake system - on the GT with internally   ventilated, perforated 360-millimetre brake discs all-round; on the GT S   with discs measuring 390 millimetres in diameter at the front, to cope   with the higher performance, as well as red brake callipers. A ceramic   high-performance composite brake system is available for both models as   an option. Its advantages: lower weight, longer service life and even   better fade resistance thanks to the ceramic brake discs with a diameter   of 402 millimetres at the front and 360 millimetres at the rear.</p>
    <h4>Forged wheels and sports tyres as an option</h4>
    <p>As   standard, the GT is shod in 10-spoke light-alloy wheels, 9 x 19 inch   (front) and 11 x 19 inch (rear), with 255/35 R 19 and 295/35 R 19 tyres.   On the GT S the dimensions are 9 x 19 inch (front) with 265/35 R 19   tyres and 11 x 20 inch (rear) with 295/30 R 20 tyres. A host of   different design and colour variants are available as options for both   models, such as the ultralight forged wheels in cross-spoke design,   painted black matt, with high-sheen rim flange and fully integrated   wheel bolt covers.</p>
    <p>In combination with the AMG DYNAMIC PLUS   package, specially developed sports tyres (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2)   are available for the GT S as an option - ideal for aspiring racing   drivers on closed-off circuits.</p>
    <h4>Aluminium spaceframe with intelligent material mix</h4>
    <p>Mercedes-AMG   has gone for an intelligent material mix on the body of the GT. Chassis   including greenhouse and body are made out of light alloy, the boot lid   out of steel and the front deck out of magnesium. This extremely light   element at the front reduces the inertia ahead of the front axle, thus   improving the vehicle's agility. Over 90 percent of the weight-optimised   spaceframe is made out of aluminium components.</p>
    <p>The bodyshell   weighs 231 kilogrammes - a benchmark figure in the sports car segment.   There were three key objectives during the design and development of the   bodyshell structure: optimum strength, low centre of gravity and low   weight. The high bending and torsional strength of the entire design   enables extreme linear and transverse forces from the drivetrain and   suspension to be absorbed and transferred. Unwanted flexibility is thus   reduced, with the vehicle responding rigidly and directly. As a result,   the driver experiences a sports car with maximum dynamism that responds   with excellent precision. The aluminium spaceframe also provides the   basis for outstanding passive safety.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT is   produced at Mercedes-Benz in Sindelfingen. The 4.0‑litre V8 biturbo   engine is manufactured at Mercedes-AMG in Affalterbach.</p>
    <h4>Aerodynamics for high balance and effective cooling</h4>
    <p>Vehicle   proportions, weight distribution and drive configuration, handling   stability, drag, cooling and wind noise: the aerodynamics of the GT   fulfil complex requirements. The high-performance vehicle has been   developed aerodynamically with one clear objective in mind: high forces   must be transferred onto the road without limiting driving dynamics and   performance. Thanks to the aerodynamic configuration, critical driving   situations can be avoided - such as with a sudden evasive manoeuvre at   high speed.</p>
    <p>The design of the front apron with A-wing and front   splitter not only reduces lift to the desired level, but also helps   route air directly to and from the cooling modules. The flow of cooling   air from the aerodynamically shaped brake cooling ducts also   specifically improves brake performance.</p>
    <p>The design of the   extensively clad underfloor guarantees optimum exhaust airflow from the   oil cooler in the underfloor area and effective airflow for the rear   diffuser. As an active component of the aerodynamics, the Mercedes-AMG   GT comes with an extendable rear aerofoil that is integrated into the   design silhouette. Depending on the drive mode, the aerofoil extends and   retracts at various speeds. In combination with the rear diffuser with   no leading edges, the lift at the rear axle is reduced to a minimum in   the aerodynamically relevant speed range.</p>
    <h4>Active and passive safety of the very highest calibre</h4>
    <p>The   brand with the star boasts the hallmark active and passive safety of   the very highest calibre. The Mercedes-AMG GT adopts numerous assistance   systems that are familiar from the new S-Class. Standard equipment   includes collision Prevention Assist Plus, Adaptive Brake, Attention  Assist and the tyre pressure monitoring system.</p>
    <p>Optional extras available include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adaptive Highbeam Assist</li>
      <li>PRE-SAFE® system</li>
      <li>PARKTRONIC</li>
      <li>Reversing camera</li>
      <li>Lane Tracking package including Lane Keeping Assist</li>
      <li>and Blind Spot Assist</li>
      <li>Blind Spot Assist</li>
      <li>Traffic Sign Assist (included in COMAND Online)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The   standard-fit restraint systems not only include three-point seat belts   with belt tensioners and belt force limiters, but also front airbags,   combined thorax/pelvis side bags, window bags and knee bags, for the   driver and front passenger respectively.</p>
    <h4>Interior with outstanding quality and superb everyday practicality</h4>
    <p>On   opening the door, the driver is greeted by the AMG start-up screen: an   animated GT appears on the TFT display in the instrument cluster. The   sportily designed cockpit in carbon fibre look provides information with   two classic circular instruments in a 2-tube look and a 198 mph   speedometer scale. The performance steering wheel with its three-spoke   design sits perfectly in the hand: it comes with aluminium shift   paddles, 12 o'clock marking and a steering wheel rim in black nape   leather with flattened bottom section. The sports seats in ARTICO   man-made leather/black fabric with integral head restraints and AMG   lettering provide optimised lateral support when driving dynamically.</p>
    <p>The   DYNAMIC SELECT Controller, the buttons for the engine start, the   3-stage ESP® and, depending on the equipment, the electronic damper   control are located on the left in the AMG DRIVE UNIT. The volume   control as well as the buttons for the manual transmission drive mode,   the ECO start/stop function and, likewise depending on the equipment,   the selectable exhaust system are fitted on the right-hand side. The   innovative touchpad in the handrest above the COMAND Controller is   integrated in front of the E-SELECT selector lever to operate the dual   clutch transmission. A free-standing central display is located   centrally above the four ventilation outlets. The display boasts a   screen diagonal of 17.78 centimetres (7 inches), increasing to 21.33   centimetres (8.4 inches) if COMAND Online is specified. The driver   operates the seat heating, PARKTRONIC, the hazard warning lights and,   depending on the equipment, the extendable rear aerofoil using the   buttons in the top control panel in the roof frame.</p>
    <p>The GT S comes with even more sophisticated equipment and appointments, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instrument cluster with 224 mph speedometer scale and red colour highlights</li>
      <li>Performance steering wheel, black nappa leather/DINAMICA microfibre</li>
      <li>AMG   emblem embossed in the centre armrest (not in conjunction with   upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/black DINAMICA microfibre)</li>
      <li>Upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/black DINAMICA microfibre</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Trim in matt silver fibreglass or in black diamond</h4>
    <p>As   an alternative to the standard-fit Interior Silver Chrome package, the   customer can choose from various other packages. Carbon-fibre trim   elements are available in a choice of matt and high-gloss finish.   Highlights include the trim in matt silver fibreglass and the Interior   Black Diamond package, all offered for the first time: here the   ventilation outlets, the frame of the centre console and the trim strips   in the door armrests come in a sophisticated high-gloss black finish,   with its surprising 3D look. The &quot;black diamond&quot; method uses the   chemical CVD (chemical vapour deposition) gas phase process to deposit a   precious metal on a high-sheen chrome surface at temperatures of   1000°C. The metal reacts with the surface to form a layer that is highly   scratch-resistant and has a high adhesive strength.</p>
    <p>The superb   everyday practicality of the Mercedes-AMG GT is also expressed in the   airy feeling of spaciousness. In addition, the good all-round visibility   and the high headroom demonstrate that sporty dynamism and comfort on   long journeys are not mutually exclusive - not necessarily a given in   this segment. A large stowage compartment in the centre armrest, a   centrally positioned twin cup holder and a large, easily accessible   glove compartment are further evidence of the outstanding everyday   suitability of the GT. The luggage compartment capacity of 350 litres   will hold two golf bags either lengthways or crossways. The large boot   lid makes loading easy; an integral retractable luggage cover comes as   standard. The cross strut made out of aluminium behind the seats   prevents luggage from sliding forward as the vehicle brakes.</p>
