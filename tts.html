<p>    A completely revised edition of a modern classic is ready to take center stage: The Audi TT and Audi TTS celebrate their world premieres at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The third generation of the compact sports car is again captivating, with its emotional design and dynamic qualities. The new Coupé is characterized by the use of innovative technologies in its engine and in its control and display concept, including the Audi virtual cockpit.
</p>
<p>"The Audi TT is the epitome of an authentic design icon and a top-performance driving machine," explains Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Management of AUDI AG for Technical Development. "With the new generation, we are making this technology even easier for the driver to experience - just as they would expect from a real sports car."
</p>
<h4>Exterior design
</h4>
<p>When the first-generation Audi TT came on the market in 1998 it was a design revolution - its strictly geometrical, formally coherent design language made it an icon with huge charisma. For the third TT generation, the Audi designers have returned to many of these ideas and placed them in a new context that is as dynamic as it is diverse.
</p>
<p>The front of the new TT is dominated by horizontal lines. The Singleframe grille is much broader and flatter than that of the previous model, with a powerful line dividing it into two zones. Starting in the top corners of the grille, sharp contours run in a V across the hood, which bears the four Audi rings - as on the Audi R8 high-performance sports car (combined fuel consumption in l/100 km: 14.9 - 12.4 (15.79 - 18.97 US mpg); combined CO2 emissions in g/km: 349 - 289 (561.66 - 465.10 g/mile). The air intakes feature struts that direct part of the flow away from the front to the flanks.
</p>
<p>The flat headlights give the new TT's face a determined look. Xenon   plus units are standard, and Audi can optionally provide LED headlights   or ones in pioneering Audi Matrix LED technology, where the high beam is   generated by controllable individual LEDs. On both versions, there is   an unmistakable contour created by the separating strip in the   headlights, which is illuminated by light guides.</p>
<p>The Matrix LED   headlights consist of 12 LEDs and include another Audi innovation:   dynamic turn signals that light up sequentially in the direction in   which the driver is steering. The predictive cornering light uses   navigation data to move the cone of light into the curve before the   steering wheel is turned.</p>
<p>From the side, the new Audi TT is   equally lean and muscular; it rests low on the road as if ready to   pounce. At 4.18 meters (13.71 ft), the Coupé is almost exactly the same   length as its predecessor, though its wheelbase has grown by 37 mm (1.46   in) to 2,505 mm (8.22 ft), making for especially short overhangs. It is   1,832 mm (6.01 ft) wide, and has the same height as the previous model   at 1,353 mm (4.44 ft).</p>
<p>A lot of the details of the new Audi TT's   profile are reminiscent of the first-generation of the modern classic.   The contour of the sill creates a striking refracting edge, while the   broad wheel arches form their own geometric bodies. The front wheel arch   breaches the line of the hood, which continues over the door as a   tornado line and runs almost horizontally through to the tail as a   strong body shoulder.</p>
<p>The flat greenhouse gives the impression of   being an independent unit and the slight kink in the rear side window   gives it additional tension. The fuel flap on the right side panel is   the classic circle and surrounded by socket screws; a light tap on the   TT logo and the flap opens. This shape is again reminiscent of the   first-generation TT. What is new is that there is no tank lid beneath   the flap. This means that there is nothing to be unscrewed and the pump   nozzle slots straight into the tank neck, just like in motor racing.</p>
<p>Specifically   at the tail, horizontal lines underline the impression of the new TT's   sporty width. Together with the LED and Audi Matrix LED headlights, the   tail lights also have dynamic turn signals. Another parallel to the   front headlights: the strip in the tail lights, which also form a   daytime running light contour - another Audi innovation. The third brake   light is an extremely narrow strip positioned under the edge of the   rear spoiler. It plays an essential part in defining the tail light   silhouette.</p>
<p>At a speed of 120 km/h (74.56 mph) a spoiler extends   from the trunk lid to improve both air resistance and downforce. All   models have two large round exhaust tailpipes. These are again   reminiscent of the original TT. Like all Audi S models, the TTS exhales   through four oval tailpipes.</p>
<p>The optional S line exterior package   makes the design of the bumpers, air intakes, Singleframe grille, sills   and the rear diffuser even sharper and sportier. And handling is even   more dynamic, with 18&quot; wheels and a body that rests 10 mm (0.39 in)   lower.</p>
<h4>Body</h4>
<p>Lightweight construction is one   of Audi's greatest areas of expertise. The second-generation Audi TT   already featured an Audi Space Frame (ASF) body made from aluminum and   steel. For the new TT, Audi has systematically taken this composite   construction principle even further, in line with the idea: the right   amount of the right material in the right place for optimal functions.</p>
<p>The   Coupé's underbody structure has optimized axle loads and is made of   modern, high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel alloys. In the   sections of the passenger cell that are subject to the most structural   stress, form-hardened steel panels, which are both ultra-high-strength   and light are used - these constitute 17 percent of the body's weight.   The side sills and roof frame are made of extruded aluminum profiles   that are integrated into the structure using cast aluminum nodes. This   structural principle creates a very rigid and safe bodyshell. The   aluminum side sections and roof complete the structure. The hood, doors   and trunk lid are also made of this light metal.</p>
<p>All in all, the   Audi engineers have, for the second time in a row, succeeded in   significantly reducing the unladen weight of the Audi TT. At the first   model change in 2006, up to 90 kg (198.42 lb) were saved, and the 2.0   TFSI engine variant of the new TT weighs just 1,230 kg (2,711.69 lb).   This makes it around 50 kg (110.23 lb) lighter than its predecessor.</p>
<p>The   low overall weight is further proof of Audi's expertise in lightweight   construction. It impacts positively especially on acceleration, handling   and fuel consumption.</p>
<h4>Interior</h4>
<p>Clearly   structured volumes with a taut surface and light, almost floating lines -   the interior is the embodiment of the new Audi TT's pure sports car   character. As with the exterior, horizontal lines and surfaces emphasize   the width of the interior. The center tunnel console, which supports   the calves when driving fast through bends, and the door panels have   similar flowing shapes.</p>
<p>The rule was once again: &quot;less is more.&quot;   Clear, purist lines underscore both the lightness and the uncompromising   sportiness of the Audi TT's interior. Two other ingenious design and   technically innovative tricks enabled the designers to create an   instrument panel that is impressively slender: The instrument cluster   and the MMI screen have been combined to form a central, digital unit -   the so-called Audi virtual cockpit. In addition, the controls for the   air conditioning system are positioned directly in the air vents.</p>
<p>Seen   from above, the instrument panel resembles the wing of an aircraft; the   round air vents - a classic TT feature - are reminiscent of jet engines   with their turbine-like design. The vents also contain all the controls   for the standard air conditioning system and the optional automatic air   conditioning system (standard in the TTS). The controls for seat   heating, temperature, direction, air distribution and air flow strength   are located at their center; the setting selected is shown on small   displays in the automatic air conditioning system. The horizontal   control panel is located under the central air vents. The 3D-designed   toggle switches activate the hazard warning lights, Audi drive select   and the assistance functions.</p>
<p>The standard sports seats in the new   Audi TT have integrated head restraints and are positioned lower than   in the predecessor model. Compared with the seats in the predecessor   model, they are more than five kilograms (11.02 lb) lighter. As an   option - and as standard in the TTS - there are newly developed S sport   seats with highly contoured and pneumatically adjustable side sections   that are exceptionally comfortable and provide excellent support.</p>
<p>The   new multifunction steering wheel has a flattened rim, and aluminum-look   clasps encompass the spokes. It also has a driver airbag that takes up   40 percent less space without compromising safety, and hence emphasizes   the sense of visual lightness.</p>
<p>Countless details demonstrate the   high standards which Audi places on interior design and craftsmanship.   They include the newly designed, split gear lever, the very precisely   engaging MMI rotary pushbutton and the finely finished loudspeaker   covers with light guides in the optional Bang &amp; Olufsen sound   system.</p>
<p>As a 2+2 seater, the new Audi TT is a sports car that is   highly suitable for everyday use. The trunk has a capacity of 305 liters   (10.77 cubic ft), which is 13 liters (0.46 cubic ft) more than before,   and can be extended by folding the rear seat backrests forward.</p>
<h4>Colors and equipment</h4>
<p>The   new Audi TT offers a far more distinct and colorful range of colors   than its predecessor. There are 11 exterior colors, one of which is   exclusively for the S line. Seven of the colors in the range are new for   the TT, and two of these are completely new for Audi: Nano Gray and   Tango Red. There are also two additional paints available for the TTS -   crystal-effect Panther Black and the highly expressive Sepang Blue.</p>
<p>There   is a completely new range of colors for the interior, too - the Audi TT   and the TTS each offer three interior colors to choose from. For the   first time, Audi is offering a two-tone interior including sporty   contrasting stitching for S line models.</p>
<p>The equipment for the new   Audi TTS includes extended interior elements that add individually   selectable color accents to the S sport seats clasps, the sides of the   center console and the rings of the air vents. Customers with exquisite   taste have many options for customization. Upholstery in various cloths   and leather grades are available for the seats, as well as three leather   packages. The S sport seats have characteristic diamond quilting in the   center section.</p>
<p>One special highlight is the exclusive design   selection which comprises a combination of two fine leather colors: dark   murillo brown on the seats and a slightly metallic shimmering   stone-grey pearl on the armrests, knee supports and cowl. Alternating   contrasting stitching, dark aluminum, matching paint for the extended   interior elements and a special woven floor mat are further features of   this elegant upholstery and trim.</p>
<p>For the TTS, the Audi designers   have come up with an innovative technical laser texture for the wings of   the instrument panel: It has a honeycomb-patterned, slightly raised   surface that gives the Audi TTS a unique sporty feel.</p>
<h4>Controls and displays</h4>
<p>The   operating concept for the new TTS has been revised from the ground up -   in line with the consistent sports car character, all the elements   focus on the driver. There are two variants of the multifunction   steering wheel available. Drivers selecting the top version can activate   almost all functions from the steering wheel without taking their eyes   off the road.</p>
<p>The second control unit is the likewise newly   developed MMI terminal on the console of the center tunnel. Two toggle   switches activate the navigation/map, telephone, radio and media menus.   There are two buttons on both sides of the central rotary pushbutton,   supplemented by a main menu and a back button. The driver can easily   enter destinations using the touchpad on the top of the rotary   pushbutton (from the Connectivity package upwards) - the MMI touch   recognizes your personal handwriting. It is also possible to scroll   through lists or zoom in on maps.</p>
<p>The menu structure of the MMI   resembles that of a smartphone, including the free-text search. All   important functions can be accessed directly. One special highlight is   the MMI direct search. This enables you to start writing immediately   when navigating, without having to use a set form. In most cases,   inputting four letters is enough for you to see relevant destinations   throughout Europe. The two side buttons activate context-dependent   functions (right button) and options (left button). The operating logic   is easy to understand and conveys a completely novel &quot;joy of use.&quot;</p>
<p>Alongside   the operations possible using the control panel, the Audi TT offers a   further possibility: the voice control system. Audi is also breaking new   ground in this area, too. For the first time in the Audi TT, natural   voice controls are used that enable simple commands - such as &quot;Take me   to Munich&quot; or &quot;I want to talk to Sabine&quot; - to control the vehicle   systems without having to take your hands off the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Instead   of the conventional analog displays, the new TT has the Audi virtual   cockpit on board - this fully digital instrument cluster sets new   standards with its dynamic animations and precise graphics. Drivers can   choose between two display modes: In the classic view, the speedometer   and rev counter are in the foreground; in &quot;infotainment&quot; mode the   virtual instruments are smaller. The space that becomes free as a result   provides ample room for other functions, such as the navigation map. In   the Audi TTS there is a third, sporty mode. Here, the centrally   positioned rev counter dominates the display.</p>
<p>With a resolution of   1,440 x 540 pixels, the 12.3&quot; TFT screen boasts brilliantly sharp   images. At work in the background is a Tegra 30 graphic processor from   market leader Nvidia's Tegra 3 series. At the lower edge of the Audi   virtual cockpit, the displays for outside temperature, time and mileage   are permanently visible. Warning or information symbols may also appear   there.</p>
<h4>Engine</h4>
<p>Audi offers the new TT and   TTS with three different four-cylinder engines with turbocharging and   direct injection. Their power output ranges from 135 kW (184 hp) to 228   kW (310 hp). The two TFSI gasoline engines and the TDI combine athletic   power with trailblazing efficiency. The start-stop system is a standard   feature.</p>
<p>For the launch of the TT, the 2.0 TDI will be available   with manual shift and front-wheel drive. It delivers 135 kW (184 hp) and   torque of 380 Nm (280.27 lb-ft). The new sports car can thus accelerate   from 0 to 100 km/h (62.14 mph) in 7.2 seconds and reaches a top speed   of 235 km/h (146.02 mph). Standard fuel consumption is a mere 4.2 liters   per 100 km (56.00 US mpg), which translates into CO2 emissions of 110   g/km (177.03 g/mile), a new record low level in the sports car world.</p>
<p>The   2.0 TDI features two balancer shafts in the crankcase, adjustable   camshafts and a common rail injection system delivering maximum pressure   of 2,000 bar. The Audi TT 2.0 TDI meets the Euro 6 standard and, thanks   to its high efficiency, bears the &quot;ultra&quot; label.</p>
<p>The 2.0 TFSI is   available in two versions - a 169 kW (230 hp) version for the TT and a   228 kW (310 hp) version for the TTS. In both versions it unites various   ultramodern technologies - the additional indirect injection   supplementing the direct injection of the FSI, the Audi valvelift system   (AVS) to adjust the valve stroke on the exhaust side and thermal   management, which uses a rotary valve module and an exhaust manifold   integrated into the cylinder head.</p>
<p>In the Audi TT, the 2.0 TFSI   delivers torque of 370 Nm (272.90 lb-ft) from 1,600 to 4,300 rpm. It   accelerates the Coupé - which has a six-speed manual transmission and   front-wheel drive - from 0 to 100 km/h (62.14 mph) in 6.0 seconds, and   on up to an electronically governed top speed of 250 km/h (155.34 mph).</p>
<p>On   the version with six-speed S tronic and quattro all-wheel drive, the   key figures are as follows: the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62.14 mph)   takes 5.3 seconds; top speed is 250 km/h (155.34 mph); fuel consumption   of 6.8 liters per 100 km (34.59 US mpg) and CO2 emissions of 159 g per   km (255.89 g/mile). The dual-clutch transmission shifts through the six   gears without any noticeable interruption in traction, and in manual   model it can be controlled by paddles on the steering wheel. In the   &quot;efficiency&quot; mode of Audi drive select, the S tronic selects freewheel   as soon as the driver takes his or her foot off the gas pedal.</p>
<p>The   Audi TTS is a peak performer. It covers the standard sprint in 4.7   seconds; its top speed is electronically governed at 250 km/h (155.34   mph). The 2.0 TFSI produces 380 Nm (280.27 lb-ft) of torque at an engine   speed of between 1,800 and 5,700 rpm. Controllable flaps in the exhaust   system modulate the sporty sound and make it even richer. A manual   transmission is standard. The S tronic option includes launch control,   which regulates maximum acceleration from a standstill.</p>
<h4>quattro drive</h4>
<p>In   the new Audi TT, quattro permanent all-wheel drive delivers additional   stability, traction and driving fun. It has been consistently advanced   and optimized especially for the new TT. Its electro-hydraulically   controlled multi-plate clutch is mounted on the rear axle. The special   pump design reduces weight by around 1.5 kg (3.31 lb) compared with the   previous model. The distribution of drive torque between the axles is   controlled electronically within fractions of a second.</p>
<p>The   intelligence of quattro drive - in other words, the software that   determines precisely the possible torque distribution between the front   and rear axles - is a completely new development especially for the TT.   The innovative control philosophy continuously senses the ambient   conditions, driving status and the driver's wishes. This means that the   ideal distribution of torque is calculated and the TT's dynamic drive   characteristics enhanced in every situation.</p>
<p>By networking quattro   drive with Audi drive select, the driver of the new Audi TT can adjust   the all-wheel-drive properties to suit his or her individual   requirements. In &quot;auto&quot; mode, this produces optimum traction and   balanced driving dynamics. In &quot;dynamic&quot; mode, torque is distributed to   the rear axle earlier and to a higher degree, which means that driving   dynamics are enhanced further, especially on surfaces with low friction   coefficients.</p>
<p>Alongside optimizing the driving dynamics, the   advances made to quattro drive also focused on the subject of   efficiency. In the drive select &quot;efficiency&quot; mode the torque   distribution is adjusted to optimize the level of efficiency.   Determining driving conditions and driver type precisely allows for   efficiency-optimized all-wheel-drive control - which can even result in   the temporary shutdown of the quattro drive system. In this operating   state, the intelligent software carefully monitors the driving situation   and activates the all-wheel drive before torque is once again required   at all four wheels. In this way, quattro drive provides optimum   efficiency along with a level of traction and dynamic handling that is   typically quattro.</p>
<h4>Chassis</h4>
<p>The chassis also   reflects the technological expertise behind the new Audi TT. The front   suspension is based on a McPherson system; aluminum components reduce   the weight of the unsprung chassis masses. The four-link rear suspension   can process the longitudinal and transverse forces separately.</p>
<p>One   particular highlight is the new third generation of the adaptive damper   control system, Audi magnetic ride. Compared with the previous version,   it has been improved in terms of characteristic spread, control   dynamics and precision as well as user friendliness. Audi magnetic ride   can be adjusted to three settings (comfort - auto - dynamic) via Audi   drive select and, at the press of a button, either makes the compact   sports car hug the road more tightly or lets it glide smoothly across   the road irrespective of which mode the driver selects. Magnetic ride   technology delivers ultra-swift wheel-selective control of the damper   forces, which means that in all driving situations there is optimum   contact between wheel and road.</p>
<p>In this way, the new Audi TT's   superb driving dynamics are further optimized, and body control also   ensures good comfort behavior. The system is unique in this market   segment. Audi magnetic ride is standard on the Audi TTS and is available   as an option for all other TT versions.</p>
<p>Another highlight is the   standard progressive steering - its rack is designed such that the ratio   becomes more direct as the steering is turned. In this way, the new TT   can be steered agilely and precisely with little movement of the   steering wheel in downtown traffic and on winding country roads. The   electromechanically driven and thus highly efficient progressive   steering adapts its assistance to speed and forms the basis for the   optional assistance systems - Audi active lane assist and park assist.</p>
<p>With   its elaborate chassis design and firm setup, the new Audi TT handles   superbly in all situations. The body is lowered by 10 mm (0.39 inch) on   the TTS, with the S line sport package and with the adaptive damper   control system, Audi magnetic ride.</p>
<p>The dynamic driving system   known as Audi drive select is an option for the new Audi TT, but   standard on the TTS. It controls the engine characteristics and the   steering assistance. The driver can choose between comfort, auto,   dynamic, efficiency and individual modes. In addition, Audi drive select   influences several optional modules - the S tronic, quattro drive, the   Audi magnetic ride system, which at the press of a button makes the   compact sports car hug the road even more closely, and the engine sound.   In efficiency mode, Audi drive select influences the air conditioning   and the start-stop system accordingly.</p>
<p>There are 11 different   wheel versions available. The TT 2.0 TFSI and the 2.0 TDI come as   standard with 17&quot; forged wheels in five-spoke design, each of which   weighs only 8.7 kg (19.18 lb), and with size 225/50 tires. On request,   Audi can supply other wheel designs with diameters of 17&quot;, 18&quot; or 19&quot;,   and tires up to 245/35 R19. quattro GmbH also offers wheels with a   diameter of up to 20&quot;.</p>
<p>The front discs are ventilated and,   depending on engine version, have a diameter of up to 338 mm (13.31 in).   The new electromechanical parking brake that the driver actuates by   pressing a button is integrated into the rear braking system. The TTS   uses newly developed aluminum fixed-caliper brakes to slow the front   wheels; these are five kilograms (11.02 lb) lighter than on the   predecessor model - another example of Audi's expertise in lightweight   construction.</p>
<p>The electronic stabilization control (ESC), which   can be switched off either partly or completely, perfectly complements   the car's sporty handling. When driving through bends, torque vectoring   takes effect. If required, the drive torque is distributed from the   inside front wheel to the outside front wheel (front-wheel drive) or, on   quattro models, to the rear wheels, too. Thanks to the difference in   propulsive forces, the car turns very easily into the curve, which is   helpful for the driver. In this way, bends can be navigated with great   precision and neutrally. This significantly boosts the TT's dynamism and   stability. Sport mode supports particularly sporty driving,   facilitating steering and control when drifting.</p>
<p>The way that all   components interact and harmonize enhances agile handling and   consequently the driving pleasure that an Audi TT offers - just as you   would expect of a sports car.</p>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>All   versions of the new Audi TT Coupé come with a generous range of   standard equipment. Alongside those features already mentioned above,   the MMI radio and the electromechanical parking brake deserve a special   mention. The options include - alongside the S sport seat with numerous   leather and trim variants - the convenience key, hold assist, high-beam   assist, the LED interior lighting package, front seat heating, and the   storage and luggage compartment package.</p>
<p>As regards infotainment,   customers can choose from various options. The connectivity package   boasts a touchpad, MMI touch. At the top of the modular range is the MMI   Navigation plus with its large flash memory, two card readers, DVD   drive, Bluetooth interface and voice control system. The T30 chip from   market leader Nvidia's Tegra 3 series, which is used in the new   generation of the modular infotainment platform, controls all navigation   and multimedia functions in the car and, together with the processor,   presents all content in the Audi virtual cockpit.</p>
<p>The Audi connect   system complements the MMI Navigation plus perfectly - it connects the   new TT to the internet using the fast LTE transmission standard. The   integrated Wi-Fi hotspot means passengers can surf the internet and   e-mail as they please, while the driver can rely on the customized Audi   connect services.</p>
<p>The infotainment package is rounded out by   attractive components. The Audi Phone Box smoothly links a cell phone to   the car. Its centerpiece is a universal planar antenna which is   integrated into the storage tray in the center armrest. Thanks to   close-range coupling, the phone communicates with the flat planar   antenna, which uses an amplifier to transmit the signals to the car   antenna.</p>
<p>The Bang &amp; Olufsen Sound System features a 14-channel   amplifier and 12 loudspeakers; the woofers in the doors gleam in the   dark thanks to an adjustable, discrete light conductor.</p>
<p>Powerful   assistance systems make driving the new TT an even more pleasurable   experience. As an option the car can be equipped with Audi side assist,   which uses rear-mounted radar sensors to help drivers change lane more   safely; camera-based traffic sign recognition; Audi active lane assist,   which helps the driver if required by steadily correcting steering or   warning him or her if there is a danger of unintentionally drifting out   of lane and the park assist system with display of surroundings, which   independently guides the car into suitable spaces.</p>
