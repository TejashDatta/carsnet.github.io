    <p>The Ferrari F12berlinetta ushers in a new generation of Ferrari   12-cylinders in the form of a car that delivers unprecedented   performance from an exceptional new engine, unparalleled handling and   innovative design and aerodynamics.</p>
    <p>Every time Ferrari has   unveiled a new 12-cylinder sports car since 1947, something magical has   happened. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that our very first car,   the 125 S, was itself a 12-cylinder or maybe it's because purists see   the 12-cylinder as the engine size par excellence. Be that as it may,   every time a Prancing Horse car of this kind makes its debut, it hails   the start of a new era. There have been several 12-cylinder models built   here at Maranello that have gone down in the annals of automotive   history because of their technological prowess and the results they've   delivered. The 1953 375 America, for instance, had an engine derived   directly from the F1 single-seater of the day, while the 250 GTO in the   1960s was the perfect melding of styling and performance. That list must   also include, of course, the 1969 365 GTB4, better known simply as the   Daytona, which, thanks to its brilliantly balanced architecture   delivered absolutely unique driving emotions. All of these engines and   cars are now eagerly sought after by collectors the world over and each   one represented major generational leap forward when it debuted. This   story continues today with the Ferrari F12berlinetta which is not merely   our latest mid-front 12-cylinder model but the first in a whole new   generation of this kind of car. In fact, it is the most high performance   Ferrari ever built yet it still effortlessly marries extreme   performance with benchmark efficiency, delivering fuel consumption and   emissions levels that are 30% lower than the previous generation. The   challenge for our engineers and technicians this time was to create a   front-engined car with blistering performance that was still able to   offer the same driving pleasure and involvement at lower speeds. A   difficult task because it meant improving on the design of the 599 GTB Fiorano,   deemed the most beautiful Ferrari ever. However, their commitment and   determination has produced a car sporting an exceptional new 740 hp   mid-front V12 engine that delivers 690 Nm of torque.</p>
    <p>Its engine and driver's seat have both been lowered, the wheelbase is   shorter and a new suspension and gearbox layout have helped compact the   rear. The result is a more compact car than the 599 GTB Fiorano. One   that also has perfect weight distribution with 54% over the rear axle   and a lower, pulled-back centre of gravity to boot. Thanks to all these   characteristics, the Ferrari F12berlinetta delivers truly exceptional   performance figures: 0-200 km/h in 8.5 seconds and a lap time at Fiorano   of just 1'23&quot;. The Ferrari F12berlinetta's spaceframe chassis and   bodyshell are both entirely new too and employ 12 different aluminium   alloys - some being used for the first time in the automotive sector -   and an array of leading-edge assembly and joining technologies. This   helped cut the car's overall weight to just 1,525 kg and maximise its   performance efficiency, boosting torsional rigidity by 20%. As with   every Ferrari, the F12berlinetta's aerodynamics were developed   hand-in-glove with its styling, resulting in a plethora of innovative   solutions. Not least of these are the Aero Bridge, which uses the car's   bonnet to create downforce for the first time, and Active Brake Cooling,   a system of guide vanes on the brake air ducts which open when brake   operating temperatures are high enough. The result is that the Ferrari   F12berlinetta is the most aerodynamically efficient Ferrari ever (a   figure of 1.12 - double that of the 599 GTB Fiorano) with a Cd of 0.299   and downforce of 123 kg at 200 km/h.</p>
    <p>The product of the ongoing   collaboration between the Ferrari Style Centre and Pininfarina, the   Ferrari F12berlinetta's design centres around the car's brilliantly   bilance proportions. It has an original innovative style featuring   typical Ferrari 12-cylinder styling cues. Clothed in sleek, aggressively   sculpted lines, it offers a superb standard of occupant space and   comfort despite its compact exterior dimensions too.</p>
    <h4>Powertrain</h4>
    <p>The   Ferrari F12berlinetta's 200-bar, direct-injection 6262 cc 65° V12   delivers absolutely unprecedented performance for a naturally aspirated   12-cylinder engine. It has a maximum power output of 740 CV at 8250 rpm,   while its specific power output is a record-breaking 118 CV/l.   Responsiveness and strong pick-up is guaranteed by maximum torque of 690   Nm, 80 per cent of which is already on tap at 2500 rpm, with a constant   surge of power all the way up to the 8700 rpm rev limit. Just as is the   case with F1 engines, the V12 has very low inertia and thus revs rise   very rapidly.</p>
    <p>Driving involvement is intensified by the rich, full   exhaust soundtrack typical of Ferrari'snaturally-aspirated V12s. The   Ferrari F12berlinetta's performance levels give a good idea of the   engine's incredible efficiency, where both fuel consumption and   emissions are now 30 per cent lower thanks to the Stop&amp;Start system,   a &quot;smart&quot; alternator, and Multispark ignition system. These, along with   numerous other technical solutions, have reduced internal friction   making the F12berlinetta best-in-class for its power-emissions ratio.</p>
    <p>The   car's compression ratio has also been increased to 13.5:1 and a new 3.0   ECU has been adopted that uses ionisation currents to control sparking   and detect misfires. The Multispark ignition generates three sparks of   different durations and intensities in quick succession. At low engine   speeds, this optimises combustion and, consequently, lowers fuel   consumption. The engine is also equipped with Stop&amp;Start and a   &quot;smart&quot; alternator which recharges the battery only when there is no   demand for power. Meticulous attention was also paid to reducing   internal friction, exhaust backpressure and intake depressurisation. The   cylinder block has four oil scavenge pumps with rotors using smaller   diameter blades which optimise extraction efficiency. Lubrication is   guaranteed by an engine oil pump with variable geometry. The design of   the pistons includes an anodising treatment to the first piston groove,   with PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) coating on the first piston ring   and Graphal-coated piston skirts. All of this reduces friction between   the piston and the cylinder liner. The camshafts are super-finished   using a lapping process that reduces surface roughness to under 0.05 Ra,   thus minimising the coefficient of friction between the cam lobes and   the tappets. The tappets themselves have been given a DLC (Diamond Like   Carbon) coating that reduces their coefficient of friction, increasing   performance and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
    <p>The cylinder head   features different conduit designs, new intake manifolds and new plenums   fitted with resonators. The resonators create overpressure inside the   intake tract the moment the intake valve opens and immediately before it   closes, guaranteeing improved cylinder filling and generating a   powerful supercharging effect which increases engine performance. The   whole exhaust sequence has also been optimised - the catalysers have   been miniaturised and hydroformed manifolds have been adopted, reducing   their form and size without impinging on their capacity, resulting in   improved permeability and reduced backpressure. The system's geometry   and materials have been developed to harmonise the intake and exhaust   soundtracks to underscore the car's extremely sporty character. All of   the pipes connecting the 6-in-1 exhaust manifold to the single catalyser   per bank are of equal length and this optimises the sound giving   predominance to the first-order combustion harmonics. The characteristic   engine sound can clearly be heard in the cockpit in all driving   conditions.</p>
    <p>The seven-speed F1 dual-clutch transmission boosts   both performance and ride comfort at once. The technology involved is   based on the independent management of odd and even gears which are   pre-selected using two different in-put shafts. Gear shifting time -   calculated as the overlap between the opening and closing phases of the   two clutches - is thus zero and there is no interruption of torque   delivery to the wheels. Shortened ratios have been developed for the   Ferrari F12berlinetta and 7th gear is a direct ratio, not an overdrive,   to ensure that the car's huge performance potential can be exploited in   every gear. The E-Diff3 electronic differential has also been integrated   into the gearbox, helping to cut the car's overall weight.</p>
    <h4>Architecture</h4>
    <p>The   Ferrari F12berlinetta delivers truly extraordinary performance and   driving involvement thanks to its highly evolved transaxle architecture   which was developed with extremely ambitious objectives in mind. These   were to reduce overall weight, lower and move the centre of gravity   rearwards in the chassis, and reduce the car's frontal area whilst   contemporaneously increasing passenger and luggage space compared to the   previous V12 coupé to ensure maximum comfort over lengthier journeys.   To achieve these objectives, the engineers lowered the engine, dashboard   and seats. Furthermore the rear of the car is now more compact, thanks   to the repositioning and reduction in size of the fuel tank (permitted   in part by a more efficient engine which delivers the same range as   before) and to the new transaxle layout allowed by the rear multi-link   suspension and F1 dual-clutch transmission with integrated electronic   differential. Rather than a traditional separate boot, the F12berlinetta   features a generous tail-gate incorporating the rear screen which   contributes both to the compactness of the design, and the generous   luggage space and its accessibility, while ensuring maximum structural   rigidity. This solution also ensures that more of the car's mass sits   inside the shorter wheelbase to the benefit of handling dynamics. The   end result is a car that's lighter by 70 kg with a centre of gravity   that's 25 mm lower. It's also shorter (-47mm), lower (-63 mm) and   narrower (-20 mm) compared to the previous V12 coupé. The rear overhang   has been greatly reduced (-82 mm) while the front one has been estende   (+65 mm) to accommodate the cooling systems required for the powerful   V12 engine. Weight distribution is ideal - 54% at the rear - and is   unmatched by competitors within the segment.</p>
    <h4>Chassis and Bodyshell</h4>
    <p>The   Ferrari F12berlinetta's spaceframe chassis and bodyshell are completely   new and use different types of materials and technologies, many of   which originated in the aeronautical industry. No fewer than 12   different types of alloy have been used, including two new structural   alloys. This has helped keep the car's weight down (50 kg has been saved   on the body-in-white alone which equates to a saving of 90 kg if the   previous chassis were re-engineered to meet crash legislation) and   maximise the efficiency of its performance (torsional rigidity has been   increased by 20 per cent). Crash resistance (lateral pole impact and   roof roll-over) is already in line with future legislative requirements   and particular attention was taken during the design phase to improving   production quality, and minimising repair times and thus costs for the   client.</p>
    <h4>Aerodynamics</h4>
    <p>The Ferrari   F12berlinetta's aerodynamics were developed hand-in-hand with its   styling, using CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulations along with   more than 250 hours of testing in the Wind Tunnel. Aside from external   air flows, research focused on internal ones with particolar attention   given to thermal factors (including the radiators, heat exchangers and   brakes). Apart from boosting the car's fluid dynamic efficiency, this   research also led to a reduction in volumes through the optimised   packaging of the car's mechanical components. The result is that it is   the most overall aerodynamically efficient Ferrari ever, a fact attested   to by a figure of 1.12 (double that of the 599 GTB Fiorano). Downforce   has been boosted by 76 per cent (123 kg at 200 km/h) while drag has been   significantly reduced (the Cd is just 0.299).</p>
    <p>The Ferrari   F12berlinetta's aerodynamic efficiency brass is mostly generated by   three elements: the Aero Bridge, the Blown Spoiler, the aerodynamic   underbody. The Aero Bridge is an innovative solution that uses the   bonnet to create downforce for the first time. It does so by availing of   an aerodynamic channel on each side. These pass below a bridge in the   area between the front wheelarch and the bottom of the A-pillar and   deflect the airflow into scoops in the flanks where it interacts with   the wake from the wheel wells to decrease drag. The Blown Spoiler uses   the air flows near the rear of the car to modify, via special intakes,   the pressure field in the wheel well, boosting overall efficiency.   Lastly, the car's flat underbody has been greatly evolved, not least   thanks to the fact that the front splitter which is now separate to the   bumper. This generates downforce whilst simultaneously directing the air   flows towards the rear extractor, improving efficiency. Aerodynamic   dams and semi-cone diffusers have been placed ahead of the front wheels   which, as well as generating downforce, also help cool the brakes. The   rear dam has the dual role of directing the airflow away from the wheel   and generating a vortex that isolates the underbody from the centrifugal   forces caused by the movement of the rear wheels. The generous rear   diffuser, has four fins, the middle two of which have vortex generators,   and thus also contributes to the significant increase in downforce.   When it comes to integrating fluid dynamics and thermal management, the   central air vent on the bonnet boosts the efficiency of the cooling   system and also helps lessen the impact of the air on the windscreen at   high speeds, creating a cushion that deflects the natural air flow. Drag   is also reduced by the Active Brake Cooling system of guide vanes on   the brake air ducts which open only if brake operating temperatures are   high enough.</p>
    <h4>Styling</h4>
    <p>Designed by the   Ferrari Styling Centre in collaboration with Pininfarina, the   F12berlinetta strikes a perfect balance between maximum aerodynamic   efficiency and the elegant proportions typical of Ferrari's   front-engined V12 cars. Designers and engineers worked in tandem to   sculpt its surfaces so that they seamlessly incorporate the car's many   innovative aerodynamic solutions by &quot;subtraction&quot; rather than having it   bristling with different appendages. The result of this collaboration is   an innovative system of air flows which make this car absolutely   original and unique, a true marriage of technology and aesthetics: an   essential requisite for all Prancing Horse cars in which form and   function are inextricably linked. The Ferrari F12berlinetta has low,   sleek coupé lines with powerfully sculpted flanks whose contours curve   and dip to channel the air flows from the bonnet. The two aerodynamic   channels, created by reducing the volume between the wings and central   bonnet bulge, pass below a bridge in the area between the front   wheelarch and the bottom of the A-pillar, before flowing into scoops in   the flanks, lifting and lightening the car's look.</p>
    <p>The front of   the car is dominated by an imposing grille that draws air into the   engine bay to cool the V12. On either side of it are   electronically-controlled guide vanes which help cool the brakes. This   is an original, active aerodynamic solution as, when closed, they cut   drag and, when open, guarantee optimal brake cooling. The rear of the   Ferrari F12berlinetta is characterised by a modern, functional   reinterpretation of the Kamm tail which seamlessly integrates the two   vertical fences of the rear diffuser. The resulting original T-shape   also incorporates two full-LED circular tail-lights and the clearly   F1-inspired rear fog light.</p>
    <h4>Vehicle dynamics and performance</h4>
    <p>With   a Fiorano lap time of just 1'23&quot;, 0-100 km/h acceleration in 3.1   seconds and 0 to 200 km/h in 8.5 seconds, the Ferrari F12berlinetta is   the most high-performance car in Ferrari history. On top of pure   performance figures, however, it is also incredibly fluid and intuitive   to drive, thanks to its unique handling which inspires confidence at all   speeds, not just on the limit on the track. This was achieved thanks in   great part to the development work carried out on the layout which has   helped the car take a massive leap forward in terms of agility and   responsiveness, even at slower speeds, a characteristic more in keeping   with mid-rear-engined cars until now. In addition to this, however, all   the car's sub-systems were developed and integrated with each other   specifically to achieve these goals without compromising on high   standards of occupant comfort. The latter include springs and dampers,   wheels and tyres, yaw control systems, such as the E-Diff, traction   control (F1-Trac), Stability Control (ESC), and auxiliary braking   systems, such as ABS/EBD, which work in coordination to transfer torque   in the most intelligent and efficient way possible to get the most out   of the performance available.</p>
    <p>The new carbon-ceramic braking   system (CCM3) benefits from the latest developments, including a new   material mix for the rear pads and an optimised cooling system derived   from Ferrari's F1 experience, along with the Active Brake Cooling at the   front. Combined, these improvements eliminate fade and deliver   excellent stopping distances (131 m from 200 km/h, an impressive 7-metre   improvement on the 599 GTB Fiorano).</p>
    <p>The Ferrari F12berlinetta   features traditional double wishbone suspension with lower L-arm at the   front and multi-link at the rear. It also sports the new SCM-E   magnetorheological dampers which have twin solenoids and a new ECU with   upgraded software. The system uses a fluid whose viscosity is altered by   an electronically-controlled magnetic field generated inside the   damper. This in turn translates into faster response times and more   precise bump control which improves both performance and ride comfort.   The F12berlinetta thus has faster acceleration than any other road-going   Ferrari. Benchmark performance is marche by outstanding driver   involvement courtesy of later braking, quicker turn-in, higher entry   speeds and greater lateral acceleration through bends. The car requie   less steering input at the wheel during cornering, there is better   traction accelerating out of bends and braking distances are drastically   reduced too.</p>
    <h4>Cockpit and comfort on-board</h4>
    <p>Ferrari   F12berlinetta's cabin design features a cutting-edge look that is   understated yet sophisticated. Volumes have been reduced to a minimum to   enhance sportiness and efficiency. The interior space has been   optimised to ensure that the driving experience is both sporty and   comfortable at once. The perfect balance between advanced technologies   and the sophisticated, beautifully hand-executed detailing of the Frau   leather interior reflects the values that lie at the core of Ferrari's   DNA. The design's strongest feature is the logical, ergonomic layout of   the various functions within the cockpit: light and essential   architecture embraces and enhances the Human Machine Interface, which   places all the major controls on the steering wheel, and displays all   the main information in the main binnacle straight ahead. The   elimination of the indicator stalks and the clustering of all driver   commands on the steering wheel underscore the car's link to the world of   racing. More ergonomically efficient F1 paddles and the fact that the   driver can reach every single control with his hands firmly on the   steering wheel rim ensure maximum performance is achievable in any   driving condition. The dashboard is dominated by air vents of a new and   innovative design. Of aeronautical inspiration, they are compact and are   made from carbon-fibre and aluminium alloy. An optional display is   available for the passenger-side dash and keeps the passenger actively   involved in the whole driving experience. The tunnel console is both   light and functional. The central bridge incorporates the F1 gearbox and   hazard warning light buttons, and is one of the cabin's signature   elements. Below it is an Alcantara®-lined oddments storage space and   there is also a cup-holder. The tunnel console is completed by a   longitudinally adjustable armrest which is hinged at the side to   facilitate access to the storage compartment beneath where there is also   a convenient USB port. The Ferrari F12berlinetta's door panels have a   fluidly dynamic line and again are designed around the logical   arrangement of their main features: armrest, door handle, tweeter,   speaker, airbag and leather pocket. The panel's central trim section   allows ample scope for personalisation in terms of both finish and   materials. Options include aluminium borders designed to underscore the   panel's characteristic lines.</p>
    <p>The Ferrari F12berlinetta's Racing   manettino puts the emphasis on sporty driving on high grip surfaces,   offering drivers ample scope to adjust the electronic control system   settings. On the dashboard, the right-hand satellite pod features the   controls for the corresponding TFT screen which displays infotainment   information. It is also used to control the sat nav, stereo with audio   streaming via Bluetooth, voice-activated track, artist, album and song   title selection. It is also possible to use a smartphone to connect to   internet to listen to web radio, podcasts and download Apps.</p>
    <p>The   left-hand pod controls the Vehicle Dynamic Assistance function, which   offers an instantaneous evaluation of the car's status and potential   performance levels on the left-hand display. When activated in the RACE,   CT-Off and ESC-Off manettino modes, it makes driving even more   involving, as well as safer, by keeping the driver informed of the   optimal conditions for the car at all times. A special algorithm   estimates the car's status (brake, tyre and engine temperature) on the   basis of various dynamic parameters (lateral acceleration, longitudinal   acceleration, speed, engine revs). It will then alert the driver to the   aforementioned conditions using the following messages: WARM UP (further   warming up of the components required); GO (optimal condition for   maximum performance); OVER (overheating, components must be allowed to   cool).</p>
    <p>The main objective with the Ferrari F12berlinetta's seats   was to reduce their volumes as much as possible to ensure freer occupant   movement within the cabin while, at the same time, ensuring they are   extremely comfortable and respect lateral containment geometries. The   headrest is fully integrated into the backrest, giving the seat a very   modern, track-inspired feel.</p>
    <p>The rear of the cockpit features an   upholstered rear bench with leather luggage straps to hold bags securely   in place. Occupant space is generous indeed - the seats are comfortable   for individuals up to 1.95 m (6'4&quot;) - as is the boot (320 litres).   Luggage space can be increased to up to 500 litres by lowering the rear   bench panel, which makes the Ferrari F12berlinetta ideal for longer   journeys in the company of a passenger.</p>
    <h4>Personalisation programme</h4>
    <p>Every   Ferrari is unique, not just in terms of its performance, standard of   technological innovation, and driver involvement and emotions, but also   because of the virtually endless array of personalisation opportunities   made available to it. Every single car that leaves Maranello, in fact,   is tailored to a greater or lesser extent around the tastes and needs of   its individual owner. Ferrari's rich and varied catalogue of content   allows clients to personalise their cars along four main themes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;Exterior   and Colours&quot;: offers a vast choice of ways to personalise the exterior   of your car, starting with the two new paintwork colours, Rosso   Berlinetta and Aluminium, created specifically to enhance the Ferrari   F12berlinetta's aerodynamic forms. There are also 16 standard range   colours and 10 historic ones to choose from. Sporty finishes for various   details such as the front spoiler, sill covers and wing mirrors are   available too as are three different wheel rim colours which can be   combined with coloured brake calipers and carbon-fibre hubcaps; </li>
      <li>&quot;Interiors   and Materials&quot; : allows you to configure even the tiniest cabin detail   to your own tastes. A huge array of luxury leathers, also available in   sophisticated two-tone combinations, can be used to recreate whatever   atmosphere you desire for the cabin. Technical fabrics and Alcantara can   be used too to highlight contrasts. Even the stitching can be   personalised in terms of colour, type and size to add an extra touch of   elegance to the latter combinations. Our range of seats spans three   instantly recognisable upholstery types: Ferrari tradition is ably   represented by the Daytona and Diamond-Stitched versions which flank the   sophisticated modern good looks of the new Leaf seats which have a   characteristic leaf stitch pattern;</li>
      <li>&quot;Racing and Track&quot;: is   designed to lend your Ferrari F12berlinetta an even sportier élan as its   options underscore the car's links with the racing world through   signature features such as carbon-fibre spoilers, headlight trims and   sill covers as well as new forged wheel rims and sporty tailpipes. This   theme can also be continued inside the Ferrari F12berlinetta's cabin   with the likes of carbon-fibre shell seats, new carbon-fibre dashboard   inserts and other trim, and a carbon-fibre steering wheel with LEDs.   However, the latter content not only enhances the Ferrari   F12berlinetta's sporty character but also boosts its already-extreme   performance by shaving more than 30 kg off its overall weight;</li>
      <li>&quot;Equipment   and Travel&quot;: contents are created to make the in-car experience more   pleasurable for both driver and passenger, courtesy of such features as   front and rear parking cameras, adaptive head lights and pneumatic   jacks, all of which guarantee the driver maximum support in all driving   conditions. JBL Professional has also developed the Ferrari   F12berlinetta's new stereo system which has Quantum Logic™ and 12   speakers delivering a total of 1280 W. Combined with the new evolved   emotional display, which now includes navigation data readouts, this   makes the whole in-car experience even more unique and involving for the   passenger.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The cutting-edge High Emotion Low Emissions   package also provides further testament to Ferrari's commitment to the   environment as it employs leading-edge emissions reduction technologies   without impinging in the least on the superb driving pleasure and   performance delivered by all Prancing Horse cars. Aside from the many,   many catalogue options available, owners wishing to personalise their   Ferrari F12berlinetta to an even more unique and exclusive standard can   also avail of the Tailor Made programme. The latter offers a select   group of clients a truly extensive selection of luxury fabrics, colours,   original finishes and materials - some never used before in the   automotive arena - to allow them literally tailor their car to their   tastes like a bespoke suit. The result is a set of unique combinations   inspired by the most iconic Ferraris and the racing world, and divided   into three collections created specifically by the Style Centre:   Classica, Scuderia and Inedita. Owners are flanked throughout the entire   process of tailoring their bespoke car by a Personal Designer who will   assist them in the choices and at every stage of the project's   development until actual delivery.</p>
