    <p>McLaren Automotive returned to the 2014 Geneva Motor Show with its   fastest, most engaging, best equipped and most beautiful   series-production supercar yet.</p>
    <p>The McLaren 650S joins the range as an additional model alongside the 12C and sold-out McLaren P1™,   and learns from both models as well as 50 years of competing in the   highest levels of motorsport. Available as a fixed-head coupé or as a   Spider, with a retractable folding hard top, the McLaren 650S promises   to redefine the high performance supercar segment, and has been designed   and developed to provide the ultimate in driver engagement on the road   and on the race track.</p>
    <p>The 650S badge designation refers to the   power output - 650PS (641 bhp), - of the unique British-built McLaren   M838T twin turbo V8 engine. 'S' stands for 'Sport', underlining the   focus and developments made to handling, transmission, drivability and   engagement.  Performance figures will be confirmed ahead of the Geneva   Show but will improve on the already rapid 12C which continues on sale.</p>
    <p>The   design is inspired by the McLaren P1™, previewing a new family design   language. The front bumper gives the McLaren 650S a dramatic, yet clean   appearance and sits below new LED headlamps which reflect a similar look   to the McLaren P1™. The more integrated front splitter contributes to   increased levels of downforce, giving a greater level of steering   feeling and confidence to the driver on turn-in, while also adding to   the agility and the car's handling balance. Unique door blades behind   the front wheels direct air from the trailing edges of the front   splitter, further benefiting front-end grip and vehicle balance.</p>
    <p>The aerodynamic performance of the McLaren 650S is as efficient as   the 12C, boasting the same drag coefficient figure, yet the air is being   worked harder and more efficiently as it flows over, and through, the   functional bodywork. At 150 mph, downforce levels are increased by 24   percent.</p>
    <p>The latest addition to the McLaren range accelerates to   100km/h (62mph) from rest in just 3.0 seconds, and can reach 200km/h   (124mph) in just 8.4 seconds. The standing quarter mile (400m) takes   10.5 seconds, and top speed is 333 km/h (207 mph). This performance puts   the latest model from McLaren a full second quicker than the iconic   McLaren F1 road car to 200 km/h, and 0.6 sec faster over the standing   quarter mile, underlining its performance focus. This represents a   sprint time to 200 km/h more than half a second quicker than the rapid   12C.</p>
    <p>The &lsquo;no compromise&rsquo; McLaren 650S also performs efficiently,   returning 24.2 mpg (11.7 l/100 km) on the EU combined cycle, and a CO2   figure of 275 g/km making it one of the most efficient models in class.   This is testament to the drive by McLaren for continued improvement and   class-leading efficiency.</p>
    <p>'As always with McLaren, the new design   is there for good engineering reasons,' says McLaren Automotive CEO Mike   Flewitt.  'The newly designed front bumper improves downforce and   steering turn-in. The high speed handling balance is now even better.   The LED lights use less power and last longer.</p>
    <p>Unique side intakes   behind the dihedral doors feed large, efficiently packaged, radiators   which help provide the cooling requirements of the mid-mounted, compact   engine. A new design five-spoke lightweight forged '650S' alloy wheel is   unique to the model, and are fitted with Pirelli P Zero™ Corsa tyres to   offer optimised roadholding, handling and driver feedback - the bespoke   'MC1' branded tyres have been developed alongside the McLaren 650S by   McLaren technology partner Pirelli, and offer strong performance in   normal road conditions and on track.</p>
    <p>The McLaren 650S builds on   experience from success on the track, and groundbreaking technologies   fitted to other McLaren models. Active aerodynamics, which feature on   both the 12C and McLaren P1™, have been further developed and honed to   ensure the ultimate performance and ability for the McLaren 650S. The   McLaren Airbrake, originally fitted to the 12C and 12C Spider and designed to offer optimised levels of downforce on the rear of the   car, now operates with a greater level of functionality providing   increased stability.  The newly developed system means the Airbrake   deploys whenever the car senses extra downforce is advisable - rather   than simply under braking or when manually operated in 'Aero' mode.   Below the Airbrake, a distinctive rear three-piece bumper, similar to   the GT3 racing version of the 12C, compliments the aerodynamic shaping   of the McLaren 650S.</p>
    <p>The pioneering ProActive Chassis Control   (PCC) suspension system, developed by McLaren, has been further enhanced   for the McLaren 650S. A feature of the system is the ability to adjust   the ride and handling modes - Normal / Sport / Track - in isolation from   the drivetrain, which gives complete freedom in terms of ride and   handling. These settings, for both powertrain and suspension, have been   recalibrated to improve driver engagement. The updates are especially   noticeable in Sport mode.</p>
    <p>'McLaren is a fast moving company,   continually striving for improvements and technical advantages. We are   always seeking to innovate, to be the class leaders, to bring new   technologies and thinking to market. That's our Formula 1 heritage   shining through,' explains Mike Flewitt. 'Everything we've learnt from   the 12C and the McLaren P1™ has gone into the design and development of   the McLaren 650S.'</p>
    <p>The McLaren 650S is designed to be the best and   most engaging driver's car in its class, yet it is not a stripped out   road racer. Ride comfort and refinement are to executive saloon   standards. The McLaren 650S models are equipped with IRIS satellite   navigation with Bluetooth telephony, DAB digital radio (SIRIUS satellite   radio in North America), wireless tethering, audio streaming and voice   control as standard, while also offering enhanced levels of optional   specification than previously offered. Options include fixed-back carbon   racing seats, based on the lightweight design found in the McLaren P1™,   an electric steering column adjustment assisting ingress and egress, a   rear parking camera and extended carbon fibre throughout the interior.</p>
