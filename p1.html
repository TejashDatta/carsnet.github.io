    <p>The astonishing new McLaren P1™, which debuted in production form at   the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, has a clear goal - to be the best driver's   car in the world on road and track. To achieve this objective, McLaren   is using all of its 50 years of racing experience and success,   especially in the fields of aerodynamics and lightweight carbon fibre   technology.</p>
    <p>The result is a car that has an unprecedented amount   of downforce for a road vehicle: similar levels to a GT3 racing car and   yet with even greater ground effect. This downforce not only boosts   cornering and braking performance. It also helps balance, stability and   driveability at all speeds.</p>
    <p>'McLaren introduced the carbon fibre   chassis to the world of Formula 1 in 1981 with the MP4/1, and we had the   first carbon-bodied road car,' says McLaren Automotive Executive   Chairman Ron Dennis. 'We have always been at the cutting edge of vehicle   aerodynamics, and all of this experience has gone into the new McLaren   P1™. Twenty years ago, with the McLaren F1, we raised the supercar performance bar. With the McLaren P1™, we have redefined it once more.'</p>
    <p>The   best driver's car in the world must also have exceptional straight-line   performance and instant throttle response. To deliver this, the McLaren   P1™ uses an innovative IPAS petrol-electric powertrain comprising a   substantially revised 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine, coupled to a   single electric motor, collectively known as M838TQ. Combined power   output is 916 PS (903 hp). As important as absolute power is the   electric motor's ability to provide instant torque, making the   powertrain superbly responsive. It is also amazingly efficient. Carbon   dioxide emissions are less than 200g/km, and it can cover more than 10   km in electric-only mode.</p>
    <p>Top speed is electronically limited to 350 km/h (217 mph), with the   0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.8 seconds, 200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.8 seconds,   and 300 km/h (186 mph) in just 16.5 seconds.</p>
    <p>'We believe the   McLaren P1™ is the most exciting, capable, technologically advanced and   most dynamically accomplished supercar ever made,' says McLaren P1™   programme director, Paul Mackenzie.  'It may not be the fastest car in   the world in absolute top speed, but that was never our goal. Rather, we   believe it is the fastest ever production car on a racing circuit, a   much more important technical statement, and far more relevant for   on-road driving. It is a true test of a supercar's all-round ability.   Plus many owners will use the car on the circuit, at special track and   test days.'</p>
    <p>The astonishing technology developed for the McLaren   P1™ includes active aerodynamics and adjustable suspension - both now   banned in Formula 1, due to being seen to give a performance advantage.   Airflow is optimised around the body through the use of an active wing   and underbody devices. The adjustable rear wing can extend from the   bodywork by 120mm on road, up to 300mm on the race track, maximising the   levels of downforce. The wing is directly inspired by Formula 1 design,   with the intersection of the double element rear wing and design of the   endplates being the same as that on the 2008 championship winning   MP4-23.</p>
    <p>In addition, the McLaren P1™ also features adjustable ride   height as part of the new hydro-pneumatic suspension. The revolutionary   RaceActive Chassis Control (RCC) can lower the car by 50mm in Race   mode, to produce ground effect aerodynamics. It also features adaptive   spring rates, roll control, pitch control and damping, all providing a   huge range of adjustment, making the McLaren P1™ perfect for either road   or track. In Race mode, the spring rates stiffen by 300 per cent,   allowing the McLaren P1™ to corner at more than 2g.</p>
    <p>Formula   1-inspired technology permeates the McLaren P1™. The revolutionary new   carbon fibre MonoCage monocoque forms a complete structure incorporating   the vehicle's roof and its distinctive snorkel air intake - a styling   feature inspired by the McLaren F1 road car.</p>
    <p>McLaren is an   acknowledged world leader in carbon technology. The material offers   lightness, strength and rigidity - improving performance, safety,   handling, agility, durability, efficiency and ride comfort. The body   panels of the McLaren P1™ are also made from lightweight yet strong   carbon composite, with their complex shapes tuned for optimal   aerodynamics.</p>
    <p>The McLaren P1™ was designed from the outset to   prioritise aerodynamic performance - just like a Formula 1 car. As with a   Formula 1 car, wind tunnel testing and CFD (computational fluid   dynamics) aerodynamic modelling were used to optimise the aerodynamic   flow, both to provide incredible levels of downforce and to cool the   powertrain. The result is 600kg of downforce at well below maximum speed   (257 km/h / 161 mph) in Race mode, which is considerably higher than   most other high performance supercars, and more in line with the levels   of downforce generated by a GT3 racing car. This downforce improves the   car's cornering ability, especially in high speed corners. Balance,   agility and controllability are all outstanding.</p>
    <p>Other areas of   Formula 1 technology evident on the McLaren P1™ include the   revolutionary layered carbon ceramic brakes, developed for the road by   McLaren's Formula 1 partners Akebono. The highly efficient IPAS (Instant   Power Assist System) is a development of KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery   System) used on Formula 1 cars, while DRS (Drag Reduction System) is   also used on the McLaren P1™, giving extra power and straight-line speed   both at the touch of a button. Brake Steer - an outlawed Formula 1   technology - is also used on the McLaren P1™. It improves cornering   behaviour and cornering speed.</p>
    <p>'The carryover Formula 1 technology   on the McLaren P1™ is palpable,' notes Dick Glover, Research Director.   'From the aero work, to the carbon fibre MonoCage monocoque and body, to   the active suspension [now banned in Formula 1] to the Brake Steer [now   banned in Formula 1], to the turbocharging [which comes back into   Formula 1 in 2014], to many other engine examples including the low   crankshaft and dry sump lubrication.'</p>
    <p>The IPAS petrol-electric   powertrain also ties in with upcoming Formula 1 regulations. From next   year (2014), Formula 1 cars will have hybrid power, including an   electric mode for the pit lane.</p>
    <p>The McLaren P1™ name is also   inspired by Formula 1. P1 refers to 'first place' or 'position one' -   particularly fitting as McLaren has 182 Grand Prix victories and 155   pole positions to-date, in its 47-year Formula 1 history. There is also   heritage in that name: the McLaren F1 was initially known internally   within McLaren as Project 1, or P1.</p>
    <p>Despite the huge performance,   the McLaren P1™ is also a refined and comfortable high-speed supercar.   'It is designed to be driven to the racing circuit, with great levels of   comfort and refinement,' says McLaren P1™ programme director, Paul   Mackenzie. 'And then to be used on the racing circuit, where it will   offer an experience matched only by purpose-built race cars.'</p>
    <p>Adds Chief Design Engineer Dan Parry-Williams: 'It's fast on the racetrack but still fast, comfortable and refined on the road.</p>
    <p>'The   brief was to make a refined, fuel efficient car that is faster than   anything else on the racetrack but that is also as fast as anything you   could use on the road while not compromising ride or comfort.'</p>
    <p>The   ownership experience with the McLaren P1™ will be as special as the car   itself,  Greg Levine, McLaren Automotive Sales and Marketing Director   explains: &quot;Owners will become part of the McLaren family, if they aren't   already. To maintain exclusivity, we have closely monitored demand, and   announced a production number of just 375 units - a figure that will   ensure the McLaren P1™ will remain a rarity and, if spotted on the road,   an unforgettable sight.&quot;</p>
    <h4>DESIGN</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ is very much an engineering-led design, as is the McLaren   way. Form follows function. Nothing is superfluous. Everything is   designed for a reason, as with a Formula 1 car.</p>
    <p>The mid-engine   two-seater design reflects the aerodynamic requirements needed to meet   the ambitious downforce target. But there was also clearly a desire to   make a very beautiful and striking 'supersports' car.</p>
    <p>Says Chief   Design Engineer Dan Parry-Williams: 'The McLaren P1™ reflects the   brand's core values. It celebrates aerodynamics, great packaging and   light weight, and is all about innovative technology. At the very   beginning, we sought to develop a car that you could drive to a racing   circuit, then press a button and race it.</p>
    <p>'The priority was   high-speed performance matched with tremendous composure, which would   come mostly from the state-of-the-art aerodynamics. We wanted a car that   was connected and predictable at any speed.'</p>
    <h4>'Light and agile'</h4>
    <p>The   design team worked to a brief of 'light and agile'. The design had to   be 'shrink wrapped' around the mechanicals, making the car as compact   and lightweight as possible. Even the number of body panels - all made   from lightweight carbon fibre - was kept to a minimum. The strong carbon   construction means they can 'multi-task' - acting as aero-honed ducts   and load-bearing supports. They are intricately shaped yet superbly   finished, helped by their strong carbon construction. There are only   five main panels: front clamshell, front bonnet, rear clamshell and the   doors.</p>
    <p>The McLaren P1™ sits extremely low (1,138mm height in Race   mode) with a substantially smaller frontal area than the (already small) 12C,   and smaller than any other series production super sports car. Cd is   just 0.34 - very low considering the enormous levels of downforce.</p>
    <h4>Shrink-wrapped design</h4>
    <p>The   incredibly low rear and pronounced rear haunches highlight the 'shrink   wrapped' design and efficient packaging. Importantly, the design gives   superb airflow to the large adjustable rear wing. The shape of the whole   body, and the sculpted doors in particular, are clearly shaped by the   path of the air flowing over and around the car.</p>
    <p>The   'shrink-wrapped' design concept, including the low rear deck, rear wing,   inlets and outlets, and teardrop-shaped glass canopy was initially   produced as a three-dimensional surface model by Chief Design Engineer   Parry-Williams, and his team, which defined all of the critical   packaging and aerodynamic requirements. This was evolved from current Le   Mans car principles. This preliminary surfaces were developed and   refined throughout the Concept Design process to create the final styled   shape, while still respecting all of the aerodynamic, cooling,   packaging and manufacturing requirements. During this phase, details of   systems such as the roof snorkel engine air intake, radiator air intake   systems, front underbody aerodynamics, 'low temperature' cooling system   and engine bay cooling were all worked out in detail. This involved   extremely intensive detail engineering design, aerodynamic CFD   simulation for aero efficiency and cooling.</p>
    <p>Parry-Williams   explains: &quot;An early mule prototype was built during this phase to prove   out the simulation results, while the design was still fluid. Developing   the design to this point before the styling process was essential in   order to achieve the incredible compactness, aerodynamic performance and   overall design integrity.&quot;</p>
    <p>Working closely with Parry-Williams,   Design Director Frank Stephenson wanted a car that was 'striking but   also functional, a real statement of intent. I wanted a genuinely   beautiful and dramatically honest &quot;supersports&quot; car, in keeping with the   heritage of McLaren but also at the forefront of automotive design.</p>
    <p>'The   engineering priority was unmatched aerodynamic performance. My role as a   designer was to make it look dramatic and beautiful. I wanted it to   look like a Le Mans racer with that low body, long rear deck and open   mesh rear styling to put the mechanicals on view and to help cooling,'   says Stephenson. 'Plus there is the most aggressive rear diffuser ever   seen on a road car. Like everything on the McLaren P1™, it's there for a   good reason.'</p>
    <h4>Fighter jet canopy</h4>
    <p>The   glasshouse on the McLaren P1™ was inspired by the canopies of fighter   jets, which creates a sense of flying. As with the 12C, the windscreen   is deeper than it is wide, which gives a feeling inside of lightness and   airiness in the cabin. The front cowl is especially low. Good   visibility has always been a McLaren mantra. The two glass   solar-reflecting panels above the cockpit further improve visibility and   airiness, while the teardrop shaped canopy optimises the airflow to the   rear wing.</p>
    <p>The 'hammerhead' style nose looks dramatic, giving the   car a low and wide stance but, as with everything on the car, it also   serves an important functional purpose. The design serves to direct   airflow to two front mounted low temperature radiators, which cool the   petrol engine's turbocharged air and the IPAS powertrain's electrical   system. The narrow LED headlamps, shaped in the style of the McLaren   'speed marque', give superb illumination but are also very space   efficient, optimising the frontal area that can be used for cooling.</p>
    <p>The   distinctive shape of the bonnet vents are entirely dictated by   function. These direct the hot air exiting the front radiators, leaving a   channel of clean, cold air to feed the roof-mounted engine intake   snorkel. The hot air directed over the roof of the car helps to boost   downforce, yet it is kept away from the car's flanks, ensuring fresh air   is ingested by the main side-mounted radiators.</p>
    <p>At the rear, the   LED taillights are invisible by day but offer attractive and ultra thin   strips of light by night. They are as thin as possible to maximize the   surface area for hot air to escape. This signature rear graphic, which   highlights the very edge of the bodywork, was inspired by sports   prototype racers, says Stephenson. The rear of the car is entirely open   to aid cooling and to extract turbulent air from the rear wheel arches   and help aerodynamic flow.</p>
    <h4>Inspired by the F1 and by Formula 1</h4>
    <p>Stephenson   said he was inspired by two cars from the brand's history when he and   his team designed the McLaren P1™: the iconic McLaren F1 road car of   1993, and Lewis Hamilton's championship winning 2008 Formula 1 car, the   MP4-23. He explains: 'The 2008 season was the last year they allowed   Formula 1 cars to have all the aero appendages. We had the MP4-23 in the   studio for about a year, and we studied every element of the car, which   was styled for function, not beauty. However, they still made the car   look beautiful. The car's scoops and slats influenced the style of the   McLaren P1™. Every duct and every surface does a job, either in aero or   cooling.'</p>
    <p>The McLaren F1 road car was a vehicle Stephenson tried   to 'recall but not imitate. The greenhouse graphic on the side is   similar, especially the rear three quarter window. The dihedral doors   are similar, so is the low front cowl and the side swage lines. The roof   snorkel is a feature carried over from the F1.' The snorkel itself   forms part of the carbon fibre MonoCage.</p>
    <p>The dihedral doors of the   McLaren P1™ are instrumental in the car's astonishing aerodynamic   performance. Unlike the 12C, they have two hinges not one. 'Two small   hinges are lighter,' says Stephenson. 'The door is also closer to the   body when open.'  Their complex shape helps channel clean air to the   side mounted radiators, and also cuts the turbulence normally   experienced along the side of a car. Their scalloped shapes are all part   of Stephenson's philosophy to 'push in' surfaces, and create an almost   'exoskeleton' approach.</p>
    <p>'I wanted to take out as much visual   weight as possible, to have a car that was really lean; a car with   absolutely no fat between the mechanicals and the skin.  It's as though   we stuck a tube inside and sucked all the air out, a dramatic honest   shape but also a very beautiful one. It was all part of the engineering   and design approach to fanatically take out weight.'</p>
    <h4>The final design</h4>
    <p>McLaren   has been engaging with potential customers actively in the last few   months to get their views on the McLaren P1™, about the car's styling.    Their unanimous verdict on the styling was not to change the car   presented last September in Paris.  So unusually, the McLaren P1™ has   translated to production form with very little change.  In fact just   one, the addition of LTR ducts ahead of each of the front wheels to   further aid cooling and optimise downforce.</p>
    <p>McLaren has closely monitored demand so as to maintain exclusivity, and announced a production number of just 375 units.</p>
    <h4>DRIVING INVOLVEMENT</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ is groundbreaking through the technology and performance   that it offers, but it also optimises the emotions felt the driver and,   through sensory enhancements, the driver feels like part of the car, and   more connected to the road as a result.</p>
    <p>Dan Parry-Williams   explains: &quot;When you drive the McLaren P1™, your senses are being   stimulated. The primary touchpoints for the driver have been optimised -   the steering and pedal feel - to give the greatest level of feedback,   and make the driver feel truly connected to what is going on with the   car. And this emotional involvement increases as you work through the   different modes - E-mode, Normal, Sport, Track and Race - with a real   crescendo for the senses in the fully track-focussed Race mode, and you   really do feel part of the car.&quot;</p>
    <h4>Steering</h4>
    <p>Efforts   were made to optimise the steering feel within the McLaren P1™, to   ensure that the driver feels directly connected to what is happening.   The steering geometry was finely tuned, and the steering ratio has been   changed to just 2.2 turns lock-to-lock, compared to 2.6 with the 12C.   These changes enhance steering feel and dynamic responsiveness of the   car.</p>
    <h4>Braking</h4>
    <p>The 'feel' through  the brake   pedal has been refined to give the driver a improved feedback and a   greater feeling of connection with the wheels. This enhancement means   the braking system is much more progressive, giving a more intuitive   brake feel more akin to a racing car, allowing the driver to modulate   the brakes more easily.</p>
    <h4>Throttle</h4>
    <p>The   throttle of the McLaren P1™ is tuned and calibrated to provide the same   levels of responsiveness, under very small inputs, in each gear. There   are seven individual throttle calibrations, which means that during   acceleration and deceleration, a constant rhythm is guaranteed for all   gearchanges.</p>
    <p>The pedal feel has been calibrated to ensure   consistent feel in every gear, both in IPAS drive mode, when the full   916PS (903 bhp) is available through the throttle pedal, and also when   the Boost button is pressed so the power from the electric motor becomes   available through the steering wheel-mounted IPAS button. This feature   gives a consistent, instantaneous throttle response, no matter which   mode the car is running in.</p>
    <h4>Sound</h4>
    <p>A new   device, harnessing the raw exhaust note from the 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8   petrol engine, together with an evolution of the ISG (Intake Sound   Generator), and the sounds of the pressure charging system, is clearly   audible within the cabin to further optimise the drama of the McLaren   P1™. The visceral, exciting engine soundtrack creates an aural   experience that instantly matches throttle inputs.</p>
    <p>Technical   Director for McLaren Automotive Carlo Della Casa explains: &quot;The McLaren   P1™ uniqueness is that it is without any filter. The experiences and   emotions go straight to the driver, and it is an extraordinary source of   satisfaction.&quot;</p>
    <h4>CONSTRUCTION</h4>
    <p>McLaren is a   global pioneer in carbon fibre technology. It introduced the first   carbon Formula 1 car (the MP4/1 in 1981), the world's first all-carbon   bodied road car (the F1, of 1993), and today it makes more carbon road   cars than any other manufacturer. Unsurprisingly, as the flagship for   McLaren Automotive, the McLaren P1™ has a carbon fibre monocoque, carbon   fibre body panels and a carbon fibre interior. It is the perfect   material for strength, light weight, rigidity and durability.</p>
    <h4>Lightweight MonoCage carbon tub incorporates roof</h4>
    <p>The   entire McLaren P1™ is built around its carbon fibre tub, as with the   12C, which provides a protective cell for occupants and forms a light,   yet immensely rigid, structure to which the main components are fixed.   On the McLaren P1™, the new carbon fibre MonoCage forms a complete   structure, incorporating - unlike the 12C - the vehicle's roof and   distinctive snorkel air intake, The MonoCage also includes the IPAS   battery and power electronics, while also meeting full FIA loads and all   world crash requirements. Despite these additions, the MonoCage weighs   90kg.</p>
    <h4>One of the lightest carbon fibre body structures in road cars</h4>
    <p>At   just 90kg, the McLaren P1™ has one of the lightest carbon fibre   full-body structures used in any road car to date, and uses the most   advanced carbon fibre technology. A combination of Formula 1 style   pre-preg autoclave technology and precision resin transfer moulding   (RTM) achieves a single piece. Every element of the composite raw   material used on the McLaren P1™ MonoCage, and the carbon body, is   bespoke. They are tailor engineered specifically to suit the extreme   performance and lightness requirements of the McLaren P1™, and the   uniqueness of the manufacturing technology. They cannot be found   anywhere else but McLaren.</p>
    <p>The Formula 1-style carbon includes   fibres with stiffness modulus as high as 5000 GPa (more than twice the   stiffness of steel), fibres with strength greater than 6000 MPa (more   than five times the strength of the best grade titanium), and includes   the use of Kevlar fibres.</p>
    <p>This high-technology tub gives numerous   dynamic benefits. Occupant safety is improved, the light weight improves   performance and reduces emissions, agility is improved, and the high   torsional rigidity ensures accurate suspension geometry, boosting ride   and handling.</p>
    <p>Pre-preg Formula 1-style carbon was specified for   all body panels. The panels incorporate carefully designed cooling ducts   and aero surfacing, they need to be light but strong. 'One moulding has   been designed to do as many jobs as possible,' says Chief Design   Engineer Dan Parry-Williams. 'We followed the old Colin Chapman diktat   that &quot;nothing is as light as nothing&quot;. Unnecessary components were   removed. If you can create mouldings that do as many jobs as possible,   you have fewer parts and less weight. I also hate brackets and nuts and   bolts. We ruthlessly removed them when at all possible.'</p>
    <p>This meant the carbon mouldings were more complex in shape, and more expensive and time-consuming to design and build.</p>
    <h4>Strong yet very light carbon body panels</h4>
    <p>The   front and rear clamshells are large single piece mouldings, which are   strong yet incredibly light. 'You can pick them up with two fingers,'   notes Parry-Williams.</p>
    <p>The front clamshell includes the moulded   luggage bin, which offers 120 litres of storage. The rear clamshell is   fixed; it only comes off during servicing. Two service flaps, just   behind the roof, give access to fuel filler, oil High Power Density   (HPD) battery charger socket and coolant. The wheel arch liners - also   made from pre-preg carbon fibre - double as air intake ducts and   mountings for the HPD, the IPAS battery, charge air coolers and oil   coolers and the clutch.</p>
    <p>Inside the cabin, there is no floor carpet   - it is unnecessarily heavy - and no sound deadening. Even the glass   has been re-engineered to reduce weight. The super lightweight glass   used in the roof has been chemically toughened, and is only 2.4mm thick.   The windscreen is only 3.2mm thick, including a plastic interlayer, and   compared to the 12C's 4.2mm screen, this saves 3.5kg.</p>
    <h4>POWERTRAIN</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ needed a powerful yet highly fuel-efficient powertrain that   offered superb throttle response. 'These were essential qualities for   the world's best driver's car,' says Dan Parry-Williams.</p>
    <p>High   levels of power were crucial for the car to deliver the performance   requirement: to be faster, around a racing circuit, than any other   production road car. Sharp throttle response is a key requirement of any   great driver's car. Fuel efficiency has always been a McLaren mantra -   great efficiency is the hallmark of quality engineering.</p>
    <p>'The best   all-round solution, we quickly deduced, would be a petrol-electric   engine,' says Parry-Williams. 'It gives us very high levels of power,   instant torque and terrific fuel and CO2 figures. The result is a   powertrain that feels like a very strong, normally aspirated engine.'</p>
    <p>The   twin-turbo petrol V8 and single electric motor - both mounted behind   the cockpit in a mid-engine position - have a combined output of 916PS   (900 hp) and 900Nm, with emissions of less than 200g/km. Power is driven   to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual clutch gearbox.</p>
    <p>The car can be driven in a variety of modes, powered solely by the electric motor, or using a combination of the two.</p>
    <p>Maximum   power comes when using both engines together, but even in E-mode the   performance is strong. 'It's pretty cool to turn up, silently, in a   million dollar McLaren,' notes Paul Mackenzie, Project Director on the   McLaren P1™.</p>
    <p>In IPAS (Instant Power Assist System) mode, the   battery is recharged using surplus energy from the petrol engine - when   decelerating, for example. It can also be plugged in to recharge the   battery.</p>
    <p>IPAS, developed by McLaren, can provide up to 179PS (176   bhp) from the electric motor, and can be deployed at the touch of the   steering wheel-mounted button.</p>
    <h4>Petrol engine</h4>
    <p>The   3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine in the McLaren P1™ is a new   version of the M838T unit, called M838TQ. It is fitted with an all new   pressure charging system to optimise cooling and durability under the   higher loads. The engine block has a unique casting, to incorporate the   electric motor and also to provide increased stiffness.</p>
    <p>The   turbochargers are new and run at 2.4 bar (compared to the 12C which runs   at 2.2 bar), while the compressor and turbine housing are bespoke to   McLaren. As with the 12C and 12C Spider, the turbos are water-cooled and oil lubricated.</p>
    <p>The   petrol engine on its own produces 737PS (727 bhp) at 7500rpm, and 720Nm   of torque from 4000rpm. Naturally, the engine has dry sump lubrication,   as on a Formula 1 car, and a low sited flat plane crankshaft - to lower   the centre of gravity.</p>
    <h4>Electric motor and instantaneous torque from IPAS</h4>
    <p>The   single electric motor produces 179PS (176 bhp) and 130Nm of torque -   although, as it's geared by a multiple of two, it has an effective   torque output of 260Nm. It has been developed by the McLaren Electronics   arm of the Group, and is unique to the McLaren P1™. Like all electric   motors, it can produce maximum torque instantly, greatly increasing the   throttle response of the McLaren P1™.</p>
    <p>'It helps give extra torque   anytime, anywhere, and comes in instantly,' notes Chief Test Driver   Chris Goodwin. 'It makes a huge difference and fills in the holes in the   torque curve that you often get with turbo engines.'</p>
    <p>As the   electric motor sharpens throttle response, so bigger turbochargers -   which traditionally inhibit throttle response - can be used to boost   overall power. The electric motor and 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol   engine thus work seamlessly together, serving up both instant throttle   response and very high maximum power.</p>
    <p>The electric motor has   internal rotor cooling - unusual for an automotive electric motor -   which enables the engine to produce maximum performance for longer   periods, and an outer jacket is also used to further aid cooling of the   electric motor.</p>
    <p>The electric motor on the McLaren P1™ weighs 26kg,   and produces more than double the power of the KERS unit used in   Formula 1 (179PS versus 82PS). The additional power from the electric   motor can be deployed through the IPAS button mounted on the steering   wheel.</p>
    <h4>Battery</h4>
    <p>The ground-breaking,   lightweight battery pack used in the McLaren P1™, offers greater   continuous power density than any other car battery pack on sale today.   McLaren has prioritised power delivery over energy storage, and so the   system is designed to deliver power rapidly for high performance   acceleration. The battery is capable of providing instant additional   power, which is accessible through pressing the steering wheel-mounted   IPAS button. This set-up can provide up to 179PS (176 bhp) and an   electric range of over 10 kilometres on the combined European drive   cycle.</p>
    <p>Energy, which would normally be wasted, is captured by the   electric motor when lifting off the throttle, and harvested in the   battery, especially in higher gears. The decision was taken to maintain a   consistent feel during braking - crucial for performance driving - and   for this reason, direct braking kinetic energy regeneration is not   employed. 'The priority is the driving experience,' notes Dan   Parry-Williams.</p>
    <p>In addition to the battery being charged via the   engine, the McLaren P1™ is also equipped with a plug-in charger which   can recharge the battery, from empty, in as little as two hours. The   plug-in charger can be stored in the luggage compartment, although the   customer may choose to store it off-board - in a garage or the pits - to   save weight.</p>
    <p>A fast 'pit lane charging' function means the   battery can be 'quick charged' in only 10 minutes, if needed, which   provides a complete, 100 per cent charge. The 'Charge' button on the   fascia allows the driver to recharge the battery quickly, using the V8   engine as a generator, in preparation for electric-only use (to extend   range) or for a hot lap (where maximum additional electric power can be   utilised).</p>
    <p>The high power density has been achieved through a   combination of ultra high power cells, low pack weight and an innovative   cooling system. The battery weighs just 96kg, and this is crucial in   optimising the performance of the McLaren P1™. It is mounted between the   cabin and engine bay for best weight distribution, within the   high-strength Formula 1-grade carbon fibre MonoCage chassis. This seals   the unit in the vehicle, thus avoiding the added weight of any   unnecessary battery packaging.</p>
    <p>The battery itself uses six   modules, each of 54 cells (324 cells in total), and uses a Battery   Management System (BMS) with active cell balancing, which is able to   transfer charge from cell to cell to maintain accurate balance   throughout the power pack, thus ensuring optimum performance and   durability. Due to the amount of power being supplied by the battery,   complex cooling is required to guarantee cell performance and   reliability. The coolant flow is balanced to ensure each cell is cooled   to the same temperature across the entire pack. Two extremely accurate   and fast safety-critical monitoring boards are fitted to each cell   module, reporting on battery cooling, state of charge and battery   health.</p>
    <h4>Transmission</h4>
    <p>The electric motor is   integrated into the 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine, and drives a   dual-clutch seven-speed gearbox. All drive - either in electric or IPAS   mode - goes through the gearbox. As the electric motor can be decoupled   from the petrol motor, so the car has, in effect, three clutches.</p>
    <p>The   gearbox is an uprated version of the unit found in the 12C, but   additional cooling is required to manage the more powerful IPAS   petrol-electric powertrain. Two air-blast clutch coolers are also fitted   to optimise oil cooling.</p>
    <p>Manual gear-shifting is by paddles   mounted on a rocker behind the steering wheel: to upshift pull with the   right fingers or push with the left, and vice versa to downshift. The   paddles are made from carbon fibre and optimised for weight-saving. They   have also been ergonomically designed to allow ease of use whilst also   operating the IPAS and DRS buttons.</p>
    <p>The default for the McLaren   P1™ is a fully-automatic mode, which is especially useful for city   driving. The paddles can also be used while in automatic mode, and a   fully manual gearchange can be selected via a button on the Active   panel. In E-mode, the McLaren P1™ always drives in automatic.</p>
    <h4>E-mode</h4>
    <p>The   E-mode is the most economical mode available with zero tailpipe   emissions and almost silent running. Where possible, the car will drive   in electric-only power, but should there be insufficient battery power,   the petrol engine will automatically start. The car is also eligible to   drive in towns or cities that may restrict or ban internal combustion   engine vehicles.</p>
    <p>In E-mode, the McLaren P1™ can travel more than   10km - enough for most city journeys - and at speeds of over 160km/h.   When the battery is empty, the petrol engine will automatically start to   maintain drive and charge the battery. Performance remains the same as   in electric-only drive. This is achieved through an ECU map restricting   performance to the equivalent of the electric motor.</p>
    <p>E-mode is   selected before setting off via the E-mode switch on the dashboard prior   to switching on the ignition. If already on the move, the powertrain   will then instantly change to electric power when the E-mode button is   pressed.</p>
    <p>By pushing the Charge button (next to the E-mode button),   the petrol engine will quickly recharge the battery. When the battery   is fully recharged, in E-mode the petrol engine will stop automatically.   Recharging the battery in this way takes only 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>In   E-mode, the twin clutch seven-speed gearbox will change gear   automatically. Operating the paddles will have no effect. The handling   settings are the same as the Normal suspension mode. It is not possible   to select other handling settings.</p>
    <h4>IPAS petrol-electric mode</h4>
    <p>The   default mode for the McLaren P1™ is in IPAS drive, when both petrol and   electric motors combine. Together, combined power is 916PS (903 bhp)   and torque is 900Nm - although this is limited to protect the clutch.</p>
    <p>The   electric motor does far more than just add extra ultimate power and   torque. The instant response of the electric motor provides sharper   throttle response that is normally associated with a normally aspirated   motor. This is especially beneficial when mated to a petrol engine using   large turbochargers. 'It's particularly useful just after gear shifts   to &quot;fill in&quot; the torque gap when the turbos are responding,' says Chief   Test Driver Chris Goodwin. A further benefit is that the electric motor   can provide faster upshifts. This is achieved by the electric motor   providing negative torque, which makes the engine revs drop as quickly   and efficiently as possible to the required engine speed for the   upshift.</p>
    <p>The use of an electric motor, and an all new pressure   charging system, enables the McLaren P1™ both to have sharper throttle   response and more top-end power - the perfect combination for high   performance.</p>
    <p>Unlike many other powertrains that use both petrol   and electric power, the petrol motor on the McLaren P1™ is always active   - unless it's in E mode. It will not continuously cycle between drive   modes. 'We didn't even try to do it,' says Dan Parry-Williams. 'We felt   that it would detract from the driving experience to have more   unexpected engine starts than absolutely necessary. Believe me, you'd   notice if a 737PS petrol engine suddenly starts up behind you.' At   standstill, such as at traffic lights or a junction, the petrol engine   will switch off automatically when the brake pedal is depressed, and   restart again when released.</p>
    <p>IPAS drive operates in Normal, Sport, Track and Race modes.</p>
    <p>In   addition, the McLaren P1™ has a separate button marked Boost located on   the centre console, which diverts up to 179PS (176 bhp) of power and   230Nm of torque from the electric motor through the steering   wheel-mounted IPAS button. The system operates only when close to full   throttle.</p>
    <p>The IPAS button provides additional instant power when   Boost is on and, when pressed, deploys the full power and torque   available. Unlike Formula 1, there is no time limit to IPAS being   deployed in a single press. The total amount of extra power and torque   depends on the battery's state of charge (SOC) and its operating   temperature. IPAS can be deployed in all powertrain settings.</p>
    <p>There   is also a Launch mode, for maximum standing start acceleration. This   can be operated in all powertrain modes, apart from E-mode. ESC   (Electronic Stability Control) can be deactivated in either Track or   Race mode. With the DRS button depressed, the wing remains stowed to   minimise drag.</p>
    <p>The McLaren P1™ is also fitted with a vehicle lift   system, which raises the height of the vehicle 30mm front and rear. This   increases the approach and departure angles, and ground clearance is   optimised to aid manoeuvrability over ramps and uneven surfaces. The   system will remain in the raised state at speeds of up to 60 km/h. If   this speed is exceeded, the vehicle will return to its normal ride   height.</p>
    <p>Performance of the McLaren P1™ is, unsurprisingly,   astonishing. Top speed is electronically limited to 350 km/h, while   standing start acceleration figures are even more amazing: 0-100km/h in   less than three seconds, 0-200km/h in less than seven seconds and   0-300km/h in less than 17 seconds. By comparison, the McLaren F1 road   car did 0-100km/h in 3.2 seconds, 0-200km/h in 9.4 seconds and 0-300km/h   in 22 seconds.</p>
    <h4>Active mode</h4>
    <p>When the Active   panel is not switched on, powertrain and handling are both   automatically set to the default Normal mode, and the car changes gear   automatically. Pushing the Active button empowers the suite of high   performance controls - including Sport and Track suspension and   powertrain settings (activated by rotary switches beneath the Active   button), IPAS and DRS (activated by steering wheel-mounted buttons),   Launch mode (a button on the dash), manual gear change (push the Manual   button) and the active aero and suspension settings. The Active button   must also be on before the Race mode can be engaged.</p>
    <p>When Race   mode is selected, the car automatically lowers by 50mm, and stiffens the   suspension through the use of hydraulic springs. This mode gives   bespoke roll and damper settings, and spring rates increase by up to 300   per cent.</p>
    <h4>Exhaust</h4>
    <p>The Formula 1-style   Inconel exhaust system is designed to be light and has been designed so   that it follows the most direct route from the engine out to the back of   the car, minimising weight. At 17kg in total, it is five kg lighter   than the already light 12C system.</p>
    <p>The rear of the chassis was   engineered to optimise the route taken by the exhaust pipe, to follow   the shortest course possible. By taking this action and keeping the   exhaust low, the design team were able to keep the rear of the car   extremely low. The angle of the exhaust exit has been optimised to match   the angle of the rear of the car, helping to create downforce. Exhaust   gases exit under the rear wing creating an area of low pressure.</p>
    <h4>AERODYNAMICS</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ was designed from the outset in a wind tunnel and using CFD   (computational fluid dynamics) aerodynamic tools - just like a Formula   1 car. McLaren Racing's former head of Formula 1 aerodynamics, and now   head of vehicle technology, Simon Lacey, was responsible for its aero   performance.</p>
    <p>This optimal level of aerodynamic performance   produces incredible levels downforce - up to 600kg, which is more than   any other production road car to date. 'The levels of downforce produced   actually makes driving easier as well as faster,' says Lacey. 'As you   build your speed, you actually feel you have greater control as the   levels of downforce increase the car's grip on the track.</p>
    <p>'Every   panel, air intake, and air exhaust was designed to guide clean air into   the ducts from the most efficient places and to maximise cooling,' says   Lacey. 'That's partly why the body is so compact, and looks so &quot;shrink   wrapped&quot;. The unusual door ducts draw air into the cooling circuit, the   low body helps air get to the rear wing as quickly and effectively as   possible, and the rear deck is extraordinarily low, just like a sports   racing car. The extreme teardrop shape of the glasshouse guides more air   more efficiently to the rear wing.'</p>
    <p>The 600kg of downforce is   achieved in Race mode, when the car sits at its lowest ride height and   has its rear wing fully extended. However that level of downforce is   achieved at 257 km/h - well below maximum speed (of 350 km/h). This was a   deliberate decision to optimise downforce for 'real world' track   corners. 'There is little point in having maximum downforce at V max as   you're unlikely to find a corner that can be taken at V max,' says Chief   Test Driver Chris Goodwin.</p>
    <p>The downside of so much downforce at   257 km/h is that, if the aerodynamics were fixed - rather than actively   adjustable - the downforce would be so great at maximum speed that the   suspension would have to be reinforced. This would add weight for no   benefit in track performance. This problem is overcome through the use   of active aerodynamics. The McLaren P1™ trims its front and rear wings   to spill downforce as the speed increases over 257 km/h ensuring optimum   performance.</p>
    <h4>Active aerodynamics - adjustable front and rear wings</h4>
    <p>The   large rear wing sits flush with the rear bodywork when stowed, but   adjusts automatically to boost downforce and optimise aerodynamics. It   can extend by 120mm on the road and, when Race mode is activated through   the button on the fascia, by 300mm on a racetrack.</p>
    <p>When deployed,   the pitch of the wing also changes to optimise the levels of downforce,   increasing by up to 29 degrees. The double element rear wing profile   has been developed using exactly the same methods and software as the   Vodafone McLaren Mercedes MP4-28 Formula 1 car. The rear wing can   provide a similar function to the Airbrake seen on the 12C and 12C   Spider, but it is actually still working like an inverted aeroplane   wing. The wing produces significantly higher levels of downforce on the   rear of the car than the Airbrake system, ensuring the rear brakes work   much more effectively. With the McLaren P1™ in Race mode, under braking,   the rear wing can offer up to three times the level of downforce   generated by an Airbrake.</p>
    <p>In addition to the adjustable 'active'   rear wing, the aerodynamic performance of the McLaren P1™ is optimised   using two flaps mounted under the body ahead of the front wheels. These   are also actively controlled, and change angle automatically to optimise   performance, optimising downforce and aero efficiency, increasing both   speed and grip. The flaps operate through a range of 0-60 degrees.</p>
    <p>The   rear wing and front flaps work in conjunction with each other to   maximise handling, braking and straight-line performance. The active   aerodynamics ensures totally consistent handling and driving behaviour.</p>
    <h4>Ground effect suction</h4>
    <p>The   underbody of the McLaren P1™ is smooth and, as with the body panels and   MonoCage chassis, made from carbon fibre. This flat surface beneath the   car also helps to generate 'ground effects' suction, boosting   downforce.</p>
    <p>'On a track, the McLaren P1™ would display similar   levels of performance to a Le Mans sports racer, thanks to its   aerodynamic shape,' adds Simon Lacey. 'It would have a level of   racetrack performance never before seen in a series production road   car.'</p>
    <p>Every design detail optimises aerodynamics, from the door   shape, which is designed to funnel air with maximum aero efficiency, to   the numerous ducts, to the wheel-arch shapes to the snorkel intake on   the roof. The latter detail also ties in with Grand Prix design, and was   an iconic feature of the seminal McLaren F1 road car.</p>
    <p>The   variable ride height suspension lowers the car by 50mm in Race mode.   This 'squeezes' the air flowing beneath the body, creating ground effect   suction, planting the car to the road at higher speeds.</p>
    <p>The aero   performance, says Chief Test Driver Chris Goodwin, puts the McLaren P1™   'in a different league from anything else. 'Having raced Le Mans cars, I   have a good handle on what they're like, and we're up there in that   ballpark with this car. In fact, in some ways we're better because we   have more technical freedom. They have aerodynamic and suspension   restrictions to adhere to, which we don't have to work to with a road   car.</p>
    <p>'The astonishing thing about the McLaren P1™ is that it feels   like a really fast super sports car on the road - really fast - but it   feels like a really good racing sports car on the track. I don't think   that's ever been done before.'</p>
    <h4>Rear wing with DRS</h4>
    <p>DRS,   or Drag Reduction System, is used in Formula 1 to offer increased   straight-line speed, and it is also used on the McLaren P1™. Speed is   increased by reducing the amount of drag on the rear wing, and while a   Formula 1 car achieves this with a moveable flap on the rear wing, on   the McLaren P1™, DRS reduces the angle of the rear wing to zero.</p>
    <p>The   DRS function is operated by a button on the steering wheel, and takes   approximately half a second to flatten the angle of the rear wing. With   DRS enabled, the level of drag is reduced by 23 per cent. The system   immediately deactivates when the button is released, if the driver   touches the brake pedal, or if steering input is detetcted.</p>
    <h4>CHASSIS</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ uses an innovative hydro-pneumatic proactive suspension,   called RaceActive Chassis Control (RCC), which gives a wide range of   adjustment through variable ride height and spring rates, and adaptive   roll control and damping. This system means the McLaren P1™ is extremely   versatile, and ensures it is perfectly tuned for use on either road or   track. At its lowest track setting, just 1,174mm, the car can corner at   2g - astonishing for a road car on road legal tyres.</p>
    <h4>Suspension - RaceActive Chassis Control (RCC)</h4>
    <p>The   latest 'ultimate' car from McLaren has one of the most advanced   suspension set-ups ever fitted to a road-legal car. The hydro-pneumatic   RaceActive Chassis Control (RCC) system decouples roll and heave   stiffness, and can also vary ride height. This system gives major   advantages in ride, handling and grip, and can be changed by the driver   to suit personal preferences. Handling and comfort can both be   optimised, without the usual dynamic trade-offs.</p>
    <p>All four wheels   are independently controlled, and each has its own actuators with   pistons for two different circuits, one for roll and one for heave,   meaning these functions are separate. Decoupling these dynamic   situations improves ride and handling.</p>
    <p>The damping is adaptive,   controlling suspension movement proactively, always ensuring an   excellent balance of ride comfort, grip and handling.</p>
    <p>The RCC   system includes lightweight carbon fibre accumulators, filled with   nitrogen, to provide heave stiffness, while roll stiffness comes from   two further accumulators, similar to the McLaren 12C. Small springs on   each corner maintain the static height of the car. Additionally, the   suspension system is self-levelling which, in normal model, will   compensate for passengers and fuel to a tolerance of 4mm.</p>
    <p>The   suspension principle is a development of the ProActive Chassis Control   system found in the 12C, but more advanced. The system in the 12C uses   similar hydraulic circuits to control roll, but heave is controlled   conventionally with coil springs.</p>
    <p>Through the use of RCC, the   McLaren P1™ does away with the need to use anti-roll bars, which are   heavy and compromise ride quality. The system makes them redundant, as   it allows the car to maintain precise roll control under heavy cornering   while decoupling the suspension in a straight line for excellent wheel   articulation and compliance. When the car transitions into Race mode,   not only the ride height changes, but also the suspension stiffness and   damping increases significantly to achieve race car-like body control.   However, these changes do not come at the expense of remarkable   compliance and driver comfort.</p>
    <p>True to McLaren's 'and' car   principles - whereby its sports cars offer astonishing handling 'and'   executive car levels of ride comfort - the McLaren P1™ delivers a supple   ride at low speeds and racing car sharpness at high speed or on the   circuit. In full Race mode, the car has almost no roll - like a Formula 1   car.</p>
    <p>Another technological development which features on the   McLaren P1™ is Brake Steer. This is a development of Formula 1   technology, used successfully by McLaren on the 1997 MP4-12, before it   was subsequently banned, as it offered a clear performance advantage.</p>
    <p>The   system aids cornering by bringing the vehicle's nose tighter into the   apex. It uses the same hardware as the Electronic Stability Control   (ESC) system, therefore requiring no additional components, and   therefore no additional weight. Through applying braking forces to the   inside rear wheel when the car is entering a corner too quickly, the   system allows later braking into corners and earlier power delivery on   exit.</p>
    <p>Adds Dick Glover, Research Director: 'The McLaren P1™ has   lost little in comfort compared with the 12C, but it has gained   massively in performance. In other words, the size of the envelope of   the McLaren P1™ is even broader than the 12C - and that has the broadest   capability of any high speed sports car on sale today.'</p>
    <h4>Vehicle modes - Normal / Sport / Track / Race</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ has four suspension settings - Normal, Sport, Track and   Race modes. The first three settings are selected via a rotary switch.   Race mode is selected via a button on the fascia.</p>
    <p>The first three   modes (Normal, Sport and Track) adjust roll control system pressure,   adaptive damping and ESC settings. The active aero wing and flap   positions are also changed, while ride height and heave stiffness remain   the same in each of the modes. Each setting ensures the ideal behaviour   for comfortable cruising, dynamic road driving or track activity   respectively.</p>
    <p>The Race button makes it easy to quickly change the   road-going McLaren P1™ into a fully-focussed track car. When the Race   mode is selected, roll stiffness, ESC, damping and the active   aerodynamics are all adjusted, and so is heave stiffness and ride   height. The car set up changes to optimise downforce and ultimate track   performance, lowering by 50mm, and the rear wing extends by 300mm. This   transition into Race mode takes approximately 40 seconds.</p>
    <p>Roll   stiffness changes by a factor of 3.5 between Normal and Race modes,   while heave and pitch stiffness increases by a factor of 1.4.</p>
    <p>Dan   Parry-Williams explains, 'The McLaren P1™ is very fast and capable as a   road car. But in Race mode, it produces the same downforce as a Le Mans   GT3 racing car.</p>
    <p>'It's a tall order to change the aerodynamics and   dynamics of a car, to make the suspension stiffer and to get closer to   the road, all at the touch of a button, but that's exactly what we have   done. You don't need a team of mechanics and a truck with different   springs and dampers and wings in order to fully enjoy the McLaren P1™ on   the track.'</p>
    <p>Adds Parry-Williams: 'A stiff, stable platform is   essential when the car is in Race mode. You can't have body roll or   grounding, not when the downforce loads are that big.  You can't change   the geometry of that space underneath the car, otherwise you shift the   aero balance with serious effects at very high speed. You have to have   extremely stiff springing and damping to cope.'</p>
    <h4>Wheels</h4>
    <p>Owing   to the astonishing performance of the McLaren P1™, tailor-made wheels   have had to be designed and developed. The 19-inch front and 20-inch   rear wheels are made from a novel high strength aluminium alloy, and   forged to a design which offers strength and lightness This is the first   time that the material has been used for wheels on a production car,   having previously been used for military applications.</p>
    <p>The elegant   10-spoke design provides the most efficient weight/strength ratio. As   with other areas of the McLaren P1™, a major focus was on optimising the   weight of the wheels, resulting in the design weighing less than the   12C's Super-lightweight optional wheels despite being wider. The 19x9J   front wheels weigh 7.94kg each, while the rear 20x11.5J rims are 9.72kg.   A single wheel design is available, in a silver or stealth finish.</p>
    <h4>Tyres developed with Pirelli</h4>
    <p>The   tyres for the McLaren P1™ are specially developed P Zero Corsas, which   have been developed with Pirelli, McLaren's technology partner and sole   tyre supplier. The team at Pirelli has been involved throughout the   entire development programme of the McLaren P1™, and this has seen the   tyre testing phase integrated into the entire schedule, as a key   performance component. This has ensured the compound and construction   has been developed and optimised during testing. The end result is a   tyre that is finely tuned specifically to the performance and handling   characteristics.</p>
    <p>In order to develop tyres that complement the   McLaren P1™'s characteristics, Pirelli called upon the experience gained   in Formula 1 and all its other motorsport activities, also making use   of computer simulations that replicate all usage conditions and stresses   to which the tyres are subjected.</p>
    <p>The construction of the tyres   is much closer to a racing tyre than a conventional road car tyre. This   is necessary to cope with the high loading due to the downforce in Race   mode, and the specially formulated rubber has a much stiffer   construction both vertically and laterally than normal high-speed sports   car tyres.</p>
    <p>Pirelli's engineers have developed an innovative tyre   solution capable of guaranteeing maximum stability and handling. The   asymmetric design allows the tyre to remain sufficiently rigid even when   subjected to different weight transfers, and ensures superior contact   with the ground, even under cornering and braking, working in harmony   with one of the most advanced suspension systems in the world. Despite   this rigid compound, the tyre and suspension system have been developed   together to ensure ride quality is not compromised in non-Race modes.</p>
    <p>The   tyre belt, bead and sidewall construction are all bespoke to suit the   unique requirements of the McLaren P1™. Different structures were   designed and developed for the front and rear tyres which ensure torque   is cleanly transmitted and traction is optimised. In order to withstand   high lateral forces of up to 2g through corners, the bead design on the   rear tyres is also asymmetric.</p>
    <p>The work carried out on the   structures naturally also required the use of innovative compounds,   utilising cutting-edge polymers, which improve stability and resistance   to stress. Through the use of these compounds, the tyres now reach   optimum operating temperature even more quickly, guaranteeing high grip   levels and underlining the tyre's rapid reaction to direction changes.</p>
    <p>The   tread pattern is a development of the Pirelli Corsa design, which has   been enhanced to make the intersection of the inner sidewall and the   tread have a specific aerodynamic profile, to boost the aero performance   of the tyre.</p>
    <p>These special asymmetric tyres come in one size only: 245/35ZR19 at the front and 315/30ZR20 at the rear.</p>
    <h4>Brake system by Akebono</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ is designed to offer the same braking performance and   capability of a GT3 or Le Mans sports racing car. They are a step ahead   of any 'supersports' car sold today. Developed specially by McLaren's   Formula 1 partner Akebono, the system features a new type of ceramic   carbon disc, never before used on a road car, but which has undergone   some of the most demanding and extreme testing.</p>
    <p>Prior to being   used on the McLaren P1™, and in Formula 1, the material was first used   on the Ariane space rocket programme for its heat-resistant qualities.   Stronger than conventional carbon ceramic, this material dissipates heat   more effectively, and can absorb 50 per cent more energy through the   contact patch between the disc and the pad, than the carbon ceramic   brakes on the 12C.</p>
    <p>The carbon ceramic discs are infused with a   surface layer rich in silicon-carbide - one of the hardest substances   known to man. This specially developed highly durable ceramic layer   coats the friction surfaces which not only gives superior stopping   capabilities but also an attractive mirrored finish.</p>
    <p>Akebono has   applied Formula 1 technology and expertise throughout, and focused on   each aspect of the brake systems and including materials, structure and   surface processing, to ensure optimal performance in every area. This   produces a highly reliable and efficient brake system that boasts   significantly reduced weight, exceptional cooling capability, the   ability to withstand high temperatures and maintain rigidity.</p>
    <p>The   brakes typically run cooler than conventional carbon ceramic but in   extreme conditions - such as high-speed track work - they are able to   run at very high temperatures without the degradation that would be   experienced by conventional carbon ceramic discs. As a result of the   discs being able to operate at higher temperatures, they can be smaller   and lighter than would otherwise be required. The disc sizes are 390mm   at the front, and 380mm at the rear.</p>
    <p>The bespoke brake pads are   produced in conjunction with Akebono, and mounted in Akebono aluminium   monoblock opposed callipers, six-piston at the front and four-piston at   the rear, which use Formula 1 technologies to deliver light weight and   minimise drag.</p>
    <p>The braking system has been fully tailor-made to   meet the exacting requirements set out by the McLaren P1™, both in terms   of performance and weight. Performance of the system is similar to a Le   Mans racer, meaning the McLaren P1™ will stop at close to 2g, while   offering a weight saving of more than 4kg. 'Most &quot;supersports&quot; cars can   suffer during braking on really fast circuits, such as Le Mans,   Silverstone or Monza,' says Chief Test Driver Chris Goodwin. 'It's   because they just don't have enough downforce. The McLaren P1™ has   superb stopping power because of a braking system which works in   conjunction with the downforce being produced.'</p>
    <h4>INTERIOR</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ has a clear goal: to be the best driver's car in the world   on road and track. In order to achieve this, performance and handling   are key, but to extract best from the aerodynamic bodyshape and the   groundbreaking technology beneath the carbon fibre exterior, the driver   has to feel comfortable and at ease. For this reason, the cabin of the   McLaren P1™ is fully focused on the driver, and is clear from clutter   and distraction. All examples of the McLaren P1™ will be produced in   left-hand drive.</p>
    <p>The interior of the McLaren P1™ offers the driver   and passenger a cocooning, efficiently packaged, comfortable cabin.   Light weight - as with the rest of the car - is a priority, yet the   McLaren P1™ retains luxury features such as full climate control,   satellite navigation and a bespoke sound system, developed from the   outset with Meridian.</p>
    <p>Director of Sales and Marketing for McLaren   Automotive, Greg Levine explained:  &quot;As a company, McLaren Automotive   prides itself on designing performance cars that their owners can use   regularly, so the McLaren P1™ comes comprehensively equipped as standard   with an array of colour and trim alternatives from which the customer   will be able to choose as well as visible carbon fibre in the cabin.    The options list is limited to only bespoke content that a customer   might wish to add through McLaren Special Operations, and fitted   luggage.&quot;</p>
    <h4>Carbon fibre used extensively</h4>
    <p>Inside   the two-seat cabin carbon fibre is used for the dashboard, floor,   headlining, doors, rockers and a single piece is shaped for the central   control unit to further optimise weight. It is the lightest possible   material, while offering the strength desirable for safety and   structural integrity. The attention to detail within the interior of the   McLaren P1™ is such that, to further reduce weight, the top layer of   resin has been removed, to leave the carbon non-lacquered with a more   natural look…and save a further 1.5kg. This also reduces interior   reflections.</p>
    <p>The amount of trim covering within the cabin has been   minimised, leaving as many parts as exposed as possible. There is no   interior sound deadening in order to optimise weight saving even   further. Carpet is offered, as an option, but when chosen, it is fitted   with a special lightweight backing.</p>
    <p>The racing bucket seats use   the minimum amount of foam, are encased in ultra-thin carbon fibre   shells, and mounted on lightweight brackets and runners, contributing to   an overall weight of just 10.5kg each. The seat backs are set to 28   degrees from the vertical, and there is manual fore/aft adjustment. The   decision was taken to not offer separate adjustment to the seat backs,   or electric adjusters to the base, as these would have added further   weight. The height of the seat will be custom set to suit the driver and   passenger, and can be subsequently adjusted in the workshop. The seat   back can be set to 32 degrees for racing, as it will give more helmet   head room. Fixings for a six-point race harnesses are in place, in   addition to the standard inertia reel seat belts.</p>
    <h4>Good visibility a priority</h4>
    <p>McLaren   prioritises packaging - a key to efficient design - and good   visibility, essential for a first-class driving experience. The interior   of the McLaren P1™ feels like the cockpit of a fighter jet, complete   with glass canopy overhead and, with a windscreen deeper than it is   wide, visibility is optimised. Good side and rear visibility contrast   with many other 'supersports' cars, which typically offer more a peek   than a panorama. 'Front visibility, in particular, is outstanding,' says   Chris Goodwin. 'The impression is that the driver sits a long way   forward, like in a Le Mans racer or a Formula 1 car. As with the 12C,   the centre of the front wheels sits directly below the highest point on   the front wings, enabling the driver to position the car precisely.'</p>
    <p>The   'shrink wrapped' design theme extends to the cabin. There is no   unnecessary padding or trim. Everything is there for a reason. 'There is   absolutely no flab in that cabin,' points out Design Director Frank   Stephenson. Switchgear is kept to a minimum, and only the DRS and IPAS   buttons are on the ergonomically designed steering wheel.</p>
    <p>To   create the smallest frontal area possible, and help airflow to the large   rear wing around the teardrop shaped canopy, the glasshouse of the   McLaren P1™ has been made narrower, and driver and passenger are now   brought 16mm inwards, compared with a 12C. To achieve this, driver and   passenger are angled 1 degree away from the centre line. Thus, the   weight of the driver and passenger are nearer the centre line of the   car, reducing the polar moment of inertia which, in turn, allows easier   changes of direction and greater agility. By being positioned closer to   the centre line, the glass house design benefits aerodynamic   performance.</p>
    <h4>Steering</h4>
    <p>The steering wheel   diameter is as technically precise as a McLaren racing driver's wheel.   This is because past McLaren world champions' grips were modelled on a   CAD system and scanned to produce an exact replica. Both DRS and IPAS   buttons are mounted on the wheel, as with a Formula 1 car, and the rim   is finished in Alcantara (leather is available), with carbon fibre   inserts.</p>
    <p>As with the 12C, an electric hydraulic powered steering   system is used. The electro-hydraulic pump is also used to provide the   transition between road and Race modes.</p>
    <h4>Instrumentation</h4>
    <p>In   front of the driver are three digital instrument screens, which provide   all information about the car - 6.8-inch central screen, and two   3.0-inch outer screens. The instruments are built using TFT (thin film   transistor) displays. There are four different displays on the main   screen in front of the driver, depending on the driving mode. In   electric, or E-mode, the amount of power being used and level of charge   remaining are highlighted, as well as the speed displayed digitally. In   Normal, Sport and Track modes, the tachometer and speed are given   greatest prominence.</p>
    <p>As the mode is changed to Race mode, the   screen switches to a transition page. This shows a graphic of the   vehicle lowering/raising, the rear wing extending/retracting, and the   transmission, engine and tyres are highlighted as the systems are   checked. These are illuminated green if functioning correctly, or red   should a fault be detected.</p>
    <p>In Race, there is a more race-focused   display, including larger tachometer and powertrain temperature. The   IPAS and DRS functions are also more prominent.</p>
    <h4>Stowage</h4>
    <p>The   McLaren P1™ is two-seater but it is extremely efficiently packaged. The   front storage compartment, part of the front single-piece clamshell   carbon moulding, can store 120 litres of luggage - easily enough for two   helmet bags. Further storage can be found behind the front seats in the   form of two storage nets. There are stowage pockets on the front of the   seats and three cup holders - two behind the centre console and one in   the centre console.</p>
    <h4>MANUFACTURING</h4>
    <p>Production   of the McLaren P1™ will be limited to 375 examples, and is to commence   in the new £40 million McLaren Production Centre (MPC) facility in   Woking, Surrey, UK, in 2013. Production will be alongside the production   lines of the 12C and 12C Spider.</p>
    <p>The MPC is adjacent to the   McLaren Technology Centre, where the car was conceived (and where   McLaren's Formula 1 team is based). The manufacturing facility was   opened in November 2011 by UK Prime Minister David Cameron and McLaren   Group Chairman Ron Dennis.</p>
