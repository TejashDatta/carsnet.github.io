<p>No model with the four rings is closer to motorsport, none is more striking and more dynamic: at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Audi is presenting the second generation of its high-performance R8 sports car. The V10 mid-engine and a newly developed quattro drive ensure breathtaking driving performance, especially in the top-of-the-range version with 449 kW (610 hp): achieving 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in just 3.2 seconds, its top speed is 330 km/h (205.1 mph).
</p>
<p>A high-revving mid-engine with superior performance, a consistently lightweight construction concept and an extremely dynamic chassis with quattro drive system and fully variable torque control - this is what makes the R8 the sporty spearhead of Audi. The high-performance sports car has been newly developed from the ground up - it is more taut, more striking and more fascinating both on the race track and on the road.
</p>
<p>"Motorsport is in Audi's genes, it has always been a permanent feature of our brand's character," says Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Technical Development at Audi. "With the new Audi R8, our engineers are bringing accumulated racing expertise from the race track onto the road. No other model of ours evokes more dynamic emotion. The new R8 V10 plus is therefore the most powerful and fastest series-production Audi of all time." Thanks to the close cooperation between racing engineers, racing drivers and developers, the Audi R8 has seen a clear performance increase - this benefits both the series production car and the R8 LMS developed on the basis of this.
</p>
<h4>The engines: <span>10 cylinders in two versions</span></h4>
<p>The   5.2 FSI is available in two versions: one with 397 kW (540 hp) and   another sporting 449 kW (610 hp). The range-topping model accelerates in   a mere 3.2 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) and keeps going to its   maximum speed of 330 km/h (205.1 mph). The sound of the freely   aspirated V10 engine, whose maximum torque is available at 6,500 rpm,   has become even fuller and sharper. A 7-speed S tronic transmission and a   newly developed quattro drive system transmit the power to the road.   The distribution of the drive torque adapts to the respective driving   conditions - in extreme cases, 100 percent of the torque can be   transmitted to the front or rear axle. The new performance mode in the   Audi drive select dynamic handling system enables adaptation of the most   important ride dynamics parameters to the friction coefficient of the   road.</p>
<h4>Lightweight construction: <span>only 1,454 kg (3,205.5 lb) dry weight</span></h4>
<p>The   top model R8 V10 plus has a dry weight of 1,454 kilograms (3,205.5 lb).   Despite a lot of extra equipment and greater rigidity, the new Audi R8   weighs up to 50 kilograms (110.2 lb) less than its predecessor. The   multimaterial Audi Space Frame (ASF) ensures low weight and optimum axle   load distribution. The combination of aluminum and carbon fiber   reinforced plastics (CFRP) in the Audi Space Frame opens up new   dimensions with regard to weight, rigidity and crash behavior. The   aerodynamic underbody which integrates a long diffuser boosts downforce.   The chassis, too, with its double wishbone suspension demonstrates how   close the new Audi R8 is to motorsport.</p>
<h4>Design:<span> flat, wide, muscular</span></h4>
<p>The   design reflects the powerful sporty character of the R8. A visual   distinguishing feature which also provides enhanced safety comes in the   form of the standard LED headlights. For an extended field of vision and   more brightness, Audi offers the laser spot for the high beam as an   option - complemented by the dynamic turn signals at the front. Dynamic   turn signals are standard at the rear.</p>
<p>In the new Audi virtual   cockpit, the displays are digital. The most important controls are   grouped together in button clusters on the steering wheel, also known as   satellites. In the interior, the driver has the impression of sitting   in a race car. The air conditioning controls emphasize the simplicity of   the control panel with its floating effect. MMI navigation plus with   MMI touch is standard.</p>
<p>Sales of the new Audi R8 start in summer   2015. Prices are 165,000 euros for the R8 V10 and 187,400 euros for the   top-of-the-range version R8 V10 plus.</p>
<h4>Specialists: <span>the Audi R8 e-tron and Audi R8 LMS</span></h4>
<p>The   second generation of the Audi R8 forms the basis for more models. The   latest evolutionary version of the electrically-powered high-performance   R8 e-tron sports car achieves a performance figure of 340 kW and a   torque of 920 Nm (678.6 lb-ft). It sprints from a standstill to 100 km/h   (62.1 mph) in 3.9 seconds. Thanks to new battery cells, the range could   be more than doubled compared to the first version of this   technological wonder - it is now more than 450 kilometers (279.6 mi).</p>
<p>The   new Audi R8 LMS race car was developed based on the new GT3 regulations   due to come into effect worldwide from 2016. This year it will already   be put through its paces at the factory. Despite massive performance   increases, around 50 percent of its components are the same as the   series-production car.</p>
<h4>The new Audi R8</h4>
<p>The   R8 is the dynamic spearhead of Audi. In its second generation, the   high-performance sports car has been newly developed from the ground up -   it is more taut, more striking and more fascinating. The high-revving   V10 engine is available in two performance variants. In the   top-of-the-range version with 449 kW (610 hp), it develops breathtaking   power.</p>
<p>&quot;Motorsport is in Audi's DNA, it is part of our brand's   character,&quot; says Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Technical   Development at Audi. &quot;With the new R8, our engineers are bringing   accumulated racing expertise from the race track onto the road. No other   model of ours evokes more dynamic emotion, none is closer to a race   car. The new R8 V10 plus is the most powerful and fastest series   production Audi of all time.&quot;</p>
<p>The mid-engine principle used for   the Audi R8 is not only a classic concept in motorsport but also an   important piece of Audi tradition. The powerful engines were located in   front of the rear axle even in the Grand Prix race cars brought to the   start line by Auto Union in the 1930s - a revolutionary step at the   time. In 2000, Audi won the 24-hour Le Mans endurance race with the LMP   R8 prototype for the first time. By 2005, the car which provided the   name for today's series-production high-performance sports car had   secured five overall victories at the Sarthe - the name chosen for the   road version of the super sports car from Audi, R8, indicates the   technological relationship between the two winners.</p>
<p>As the R8 LMS,   the Audi R8 is also highly successful in customer racing. The basis for   its success: motorsport was part of the development strategy from the   very beginning. In 2009, the R8 LMS customer racing race car began its   success story which would lead it to more than 190 victories and 23   championship titles worldwide. Technically speaking, it is closely   related to the road version of the sports car with around 50 percent of   the same parts.</p>
<h4>Up to 449 kW (610 hp): <span>the two V10 engines</span></h4>
<p>The   new generation of the Audi R8 utilizes the latest development of the   ten-cylinder engine. With its spontaneous throttle response, quick   revving up to 6,500 rpm and inimitable roaring sound, the naturally   aspirated 5.2 FSI engine is enough to give you goose bumps. In the new   R8, the freely aspirated V10 engine offers even more power and torque   than before. Controllable flaps in the exhaust pipe and an optional   sport exhaust system make the car sound even more characteristic.</p>
<p>The   ten-cylinder engine is available in two versions. In the R8 V10, it   develops a power of 397 kW (540 hp)  from its 5,204 cc displacement and a   torque of 540 Nm (398.3 lb-ft) at an engine speed of 6,500 rpm. The   sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) takes just 3.5 seconds, and it can   reach a top speed of 323 km/h (200.7 mph). The R8 V10 plus is even more   powerful and is the fastest series-production Audi of all time. It   develops 449 kW (610 hp) and its maximum torque of 560 Nm (413.0 lb-ft)   is available at 6,500 rpm. The performance figures are equally   impressive: 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 3.2 seconds, 0 to 200 km/h   (124.3 mph) in 9.9 seconds, and a top speed of 330 km/h (205.1 mph).</p>
<p>A   further innovation in the 5.2 FSI engine is the additional indirect   injection. It complements the FSI direct gasoline injection, lowers fuel   consumption and enhances engine output. Moreover, the R8 features yet   another innovative system in the form of COD (cylinder on demand). It   shuts off one of the two cylinder banks by deactivating injection and   ignition. The R8 V10 consumes an average of 11.8 liters of fuel per 100   kilometers (19.9 US mpg) with CO2 emissions of 275 grams per kilometer   (442.6 g/mi), for the R8 V10 plus those values are 12.4 liters per 100   kilometers (19.0 US mpg) and 289 grams per kilometer (465.1 g/mi). The   fuel consumption reduction of up to 10 percent compared to the previous   model is also due to the new start-stop system.</p>
<p>The dry sump   lubrication completes the technology package of the 5.2 FSI. The   ten-cylinder engine is hand built in the Hungarian engine plant in Gy   014Å'' type=&quot;#_x0000_t75&quot;&gt;r. As a traditional motorsport technology,   it allows for low installation of the engine, which is particularly   beneficial for the car's center of gravity. What's more, it also ensures   oil supply even under extreme lateral acceleration.</p>
<h4>Fast as lightning and highly variable: <span>the power transmission</span></h4>
<p>In   both engine versions, power is transmitted to a rapid-shifting   seven-speed S tronic transmission installed behind the engine. The S   tronic has three automatic modes and can also be controlled manually.   Shift commands are transmitted electronically (shift-by-wire). The   launch control system manages full-throttle acceleration from a standing   start.</p>
<p>Another function of the S tronic comes into play when the   driver's foot is removed from the accelerator pedal at speeds above 55   km/h (34.2 mph). In such cases, both clutches open and the car goes into   coasting mode. This function saves a considerable amount of fuel,   especially in everyday use by the customer.</p>
<p>The quattro permanent   all-wheel drive system gives the new R8 a decisive plus in terms of   stability and traction when compared with two-wheel-drive competitors.   On the front axle, an electrohydraulic multi-plate clutch replaces the   Visco clutch of the predecessor model. The newly developed quattro drive   system enables completely unrestricted and fully variable distribution   of the drive torque to the front and rear axles depending on the driving   situation and weather. In normal operation, up to 100 percent is   transmitted to the rear wheels and, if required, the clutch continuously   diverts up to 100 percent of this torque to the front wheels. Thanks to   the mechanical differential lock on the rear axle, the driver   experiences maximum traction without any slip.</p>
<h4>Audi drive select: <span>the chassis</span></h4>
<p>In   the chassis of the new Audi R8, double wishbones made from aluminum   guide all four wheels. The R8 V10 plus has a particularly sporty setup -   for both engine variants, variable adaptively controlled Audi magnetic   ride shock absorbers are available as an option. The newly developed   electromechanical power steering system provides close contact to the   road surface and makes a further contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.   As an option, Audi offers dynamic steering, whereby the steering ratio   varies in accordance with the road speed and the settings in the Audi   drive select dynamic handling system.</p>
<p>As standard, the new Audi R8   V10 has 19-inch wheels with size 245/35 tires at the front and 295/35   at the rear. Upon request, Audi is also offering 20-inch wheels for the   first time in the R8. With this option, the tires are size 245/30 at the   front and 305/30 at the rear. The steel brake disks have a   weight-saving wave design and the calipers can be painted red upon   request. In the R8 V10 plus, high-tech disks made from carbon fiber   ceramic are responsible for deceleration of the 20-inch wheels (optional   for the V10).</p>
<p>In the Audi drive select dynamic handling system,   the driver has the choice of four modes (comfort, auto, dynamic and   individual) to control the way in which important technical components   operate. As standard, the system takes into account the engine   characteristics, steering, S tronic transmission and quattro drive   system as well as optional extras such as Audi magnetic ride, the   exhaust flaps and dynamic steering. On top of that, there is also the   new performance mode (available as an option for the V10 and standard   for the V10 plus). The driver activates it by pressing a separate button   on the steering wheel. He or she can select between the programs dry,   wet and snow using a rotary wheel. These programs support dynamic   handling on dry, wet and snow-covered surfaces. In performance mode,   Audi drive select also makes use of the ESC stabilization control   function.</p>
<h4>New Audi Space Frame with high proportions of aluminum and CFRP</h4>
<p>The   R8 V10 plus has a dry weight of 1,454 kilograms (3,205.5 lb). The key   factor behind the consistent lightweight design is the body shell with   multimaterial Audi Space Frame (ASF): It weighs only 200 kilograms   (440.9 lb). The resulting unladen weight of 1,555 kilograms (3,428.2 lb)   leads to a superior power-to-weight ratio of 3.46 kg/kW (2.55 kg/hp).</p>
<p>The   ASF body shell features a completely new multimaterial lightweight   construction concept. Components made from carbon fiber reinforced   plastics (CFRP) form the B‑pillars, the central tunnel and the rear   wall. The front section of the vehicle, the roof arch and the rear   section form a framework made from cast aluminum nodes and aluminum   profiles which, in some cases, employ new alloys. As always with the   ASF, each component is precisely designed for its location and purpose.   Accordingly, the engineers have now integrated some components into the   body shell due to their function. Leaving aside its components, the body   shell is now around 15 percent lighter than its predecessor. At the   same time, torsional rigidity is roughly 40 percent better. Particularly   with regard to rigidity, the body of the new Audi R8 is a benchmark.   The resulting lightweight construction is unparalleled among the   competition.</p>
<p>The multimaterial Audi Space Frame in the new Audi R8   is extremely light and rigid, whilst also being acoustically   comfortable and offering a high level of safety. The outer skin is made   entirely of aluminum, but as an optional extra (or as standard for the   V10 plus), Audi also offers attachment parts made from clear-coated   carbon fiber, for example the front splitter, the diffuser or the side   blades. A long, rising diffuser in the underbody produces downforce on   the rear axle at higher speeds.</p>
<h4>Design: <span>flat, wide, muscular</span></h4>
<p>A   cockpit positioned very far forward, a long, flowing back and a   relatively short wheelbase - the exterior design makes the technical   concept of the mid-engine, high-performance Audi R8 sports car clear   upon first sight. At 4.42 meters long (14.5 ft), 1.24 meters high (4.1   ft) and with a wheelbase measuring 2.65 meters (8.7 ft), its dimensions   have only slightly changed in comparison to the previous model. Its   width now measures 1.94 meters (6.4 ft) and has thus grown by about four   centimeters (1.6 in). The car's proportions convey more of a race car   character, with characteristic design ideas from the previous model now   more pronounced.</p>
<p>The four rings sit proudly on the hood, the   Singleframe radiator grille with honeycomb design is wide and flat.   Modeled plastic surfaces allow it to merge into the flat headlights -   facets of the vehicle which highlight tension, provide an impression of   depth and add an air of logic to the design. The grid-type signature of   the daytime running lights with vertical elements replicates the   structure of the air inlets and emphasizes the width of the car. The   entire appearance of the Audi R8 conveys a feeling of lightness and   technical precision. LED headlights are standard. Available upon   request, Audi can also supply the laser spot which doubles the range of   the high beam to 600 meters (1,968.5 ft) as well as the dynamic turn   signals at the front. The dynamic turn signals are standard at the rear.   The rear lighting signature also combines two vertical elements with a   horizontal line. This gives the Audi R8 an even more powerful   appearance.</p>
<p>As part of the new laser high beams, one laser module   per headlight generates a cone of light with twice the range of the   all-LED headlamp. Each module comprises four high-power laser diodes.   With a diameter of just 300 micrometers, these generate a blue laser   beam with a wavelength of 450 nanometers. A phosphor converter   transforms it into white light suitable for roadway use with a color   temperature of 5,500 Kelvin - ideal conditions for the human eye that   enable the driver to recognize contrast more easily and help to prevent   fatigue. The laser spot is active from a speed of 60 km/h (37.3 mph) to   supplement the LED high beam of the R8 and, thanks to its long range,   greatly enhances the driver's field of vision as well as safety. An   intelligent camera-based sensor system detects other road users and   actively adjusts the light pattern to exclude them.</p>
<p>On the sides   of the high-performance sports car, characteristically curved contours   are drawn over the wheels. The shoulder line, shaped like a powerful   muscle, connects the wheels with one another while at the same time   dividing the side blade in two to leave an upper and a lower half. This   new design solution makes the car appear even longer and more dynamic.</p>
<p>At   the rear, as well, the lights and the air inlets visually connect to   one another. The two tailpipes of the exhaust system have a trapezoidal   design and the rear window offers a clear view of the illuminated engine   compartment. The R8 is equipped with an electrically extending spoiler,   the R8 V10 plus with a fixed wing made from CFRP.</p>
<h4>Just like in a race car: <span>the interior and the controls</span></h4>
<p>Behind   the steering wheel of the new Audi R8, the driver feels like a race car   driver. All functions are driver-oriented and allow easy operation even   when the critical limits are reached - and all without the driver   having to take his or her hands off the steering wheel. The newly   designed sport seats with integrated headrest provide excellent lateral   support. Even more radical seating for a sports car comes in the form of   the newly developed R8 bucket seats. These make a clear statement   confirming the relationship between lightweight construction and comfort   (optional in the V10 and standard in the V10 plus).</p>
<p>The   start-stop button and the Audi drive select button are located on   several satellites on the new multifunction plus steering wheel. The   Performance steering wheel in the Audi R8 V10 plus features two more   satellites. One button is for performance mode together with a rotary   wheel for selecting the dry, wet and snow programs as well as a button   for controlling the sports exhaust system.</p>
<p>The Audi virtual   cockpit is set in a free-standing housing and presents all the   information on its 12.3-inch display with elaborately computed,   fascinating graphics. The driver can toggle between different display   modes and also adjust the digital instrument cluster to his needs in   individual mode. In performance mode, the driver is presented with   information on the driving programs, acceleration, deceleration and   lateral forces as well as power and torque. The Audi virtual cockpit   also displays a shift light which informs the driver that the engine   speed limit has been reached. The driver operates the Audi virtual   cockpit using the multifunction plus steering wheel. The driver's hands   remain on the steering wheel and he or she can concentrate on the road.   Alternatively, operation can take place via the touch wheel or the   buttons in the center console.</p>
<p>In the design of the interior too,   the taut geometric lines emphasize the aesthetic lightweight   construction of the brand. Its characteristic element is the monoposto, a   large arc in the area around the driver's seat. The MMI monitor of the   previous model is no longer available. Instead, the three central   control elements of the air conditioning system have taken its place.   The three-dimensional design of the air outlet vents bring to mind the   air inlets of a race car. The dashboard appears to float weightlessly.   The wide console of the central tunnel accommodates the standard MMI   terminal as well as the newly designed flat selector lever of the S   tronic transmission.</p>
<p>When it comes to upholstery, customers can   choose between Alcantara/pearl Nappa leather and fine Nappa leather.   Also available are trim elements in clear coated carbon fiber, two   leather packages and a new diamond stitching pattern.</p>
<h4>Customization</h4>
<p>There   are numerous customization possibilities for customers of the new Audi   R8 - for both the exterior and the interior. The colors for the body   have been newly mixed and can be freely combined with the colors of the   side blades - a blade made from glossy carbon is a particular highlight   of the range. Ten standard exterior colors are available, for the R8 V10   plus there is an additional matt paint finish available, Camouflage   Green.</p>
<p>Among the five equipment colors available for the interior,   two color ranges can be found, whereby the interior is always   characterized by a sporty feel. Additionally, there are numerous options   to further customize both the interior and the exterior, for example   with headlining in Alcantara with dynamic diamond stitching pattern. The   Audi exclusive program makes it possible for you to turn the new R8   into a one-of-a-kind model.</p>
<h4>Completely connected: <span>infotainment</span></h4>
<p>In   the new Audi R8, the Audi virtual cockpit replaces the analog   instruments and the MMI monitor. The driver can switch the all-digital   display between two different view modes. These bring either the virtual   dial instruments or the large navigation map into focus.</p>
<p>The Audi   R8 makes use of the latest technology in terms of infotainment. MMI   navigation plus is installed as standard; the MMI touch touch wheel is   the central control element. In the background, the second generation of   the modular infotainment platform sets about its work - just like the   Audi virtual cockpit, it integrates a super-fast T30 chip from Audi's   cooperation partner, NVIDIA.</p>
<p>MMI navigation plus is complemented   by the Audi connect module. The passenger can connect a smartphone or   tablet via the system's integrated Wi-Fi hotspot. Tailored online   services from Audi connect are displayed on the Audi virtual cockpit.   The internet connection uses the fast LTE (Long Term Evolution) network.   Optional components such as the fine-tuned sound system from Bang &amp;   Olufsen with a system performance of 500 watts or the Audi phone box   for convenient cell phone integration round off the infotainment   program.</p>
<h4>New factory for quattro GmbH: <span>production at the &quot;Böllinger Höfe&quot; site</span></h4>
<p>The   new Audi R8 is produced at a new quattro GmbH production site that was   specially built for the sports car - the &quot;Böllinger Höfe&quot; site in   Heilbronn. An elaborate manufacturing technique ensures that   Audi-typical quality is produced.</p>

<p>The  new &quot;Böllinger Höfe&quot; quattro GmbH   production site is close to the Neckarsulm plant. The production area   covering 30,000 m2 (322,917.3 sq ft) comprises a body shop and assembly   facilities. The entire production facility is highly flexible, while   technical and ergonomic innovations such as the CFRP body shell   construction and driverless transport systems ensure top quality.</p>
<p>As   was the case for the previous model, production follows an elaborate   manufacturing process. In cycle times of about 30 minutes and with up to   400 highly qualified employees, the R8 is created in highly precise   craftsmanship. Following completion, each R8 is subjected to a strict   quality acceptance process on the internal plant test track and an   approximately one-hour test drive on public roads. With the new R8   manufacturing site, quattro GmbH - the high-performance subsidiary of   AUDI AG - is further enhancing its small-series expertise, thus creating   the opportunity to realize ever more exciting derivatives of the R8.</p>
