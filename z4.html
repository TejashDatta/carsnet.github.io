<p>The BMW Z4 Roadster represents the interplay of classical proportions   and state-of-the-art technology. An updated version of the modern   classic is set to arrive in BMW showrooms in time for spring 2013.</p>
<p>The   new BMW Z4 represents a time-honored and yet contemporary   interpretation of the traditional roadster concept. New exterior   features, detailed interior refinements, the new Hyper Orange design   package, as well as availability of the full range of BMW ConnectedDrive   features all provide fresh impetus and lend the BMW Roadster even   greater appeal and individuality.</p>
<p>The new BMW Z4 takes to the stage 25 years after the legendary BMW Z1 began the modern era of BMW Roadsters. That Roadster turned heads when   it was unveiled at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show not only for its   revolutionary door concept, but also thanks to its agile and responsive   handling. With the BMW Z1 began the latest chapter in the history of BMW   Roadsters - a tradition which stretches back to the 1930s and reached   the first of many high points with the BMW 328 (winner of the 1940 Mille Miglia) and BMW 507 from 1955. The BMW Z3 and BMW Z8 triggered a fresh wave of excitement for the classic open-top   two-seater concept in the 1990s. And they also paved the way for the first-generation BMW Z4 and its successor, the brand's first Roadster fitted with a retractable hardtop.</p>
<h4>Design:<span> classical proportions infused with modern character</span></h4>
<p>The   success of modern-day BMW Roadsters is rooted in the rigorous   dedication of a concept, a process which has left its mark on both the   design and the driving properties of each car and is clearly   recognizable in the new BMW Z4. The sweeping hood, long wheelbase, low   beltline and low-slung rear end play a more vivid and uncompromising   part in shaping its appearance than is evident with any of its segment   rivals. The low seating position just ahead of the rear axle gives the   driver and passenger a particularly intense experience of the   longitudinal and lateral forces working on the rear wheels. This sense   of being &quot;part of the car&quot; also allows the driver to feel more in touch   with the road.</p>
<p>The hardtop roof also blends seamlessly into the   car's form. As it closes, it seals a smoothly flowing roofline, while   large window surfaces optimize all-round visibility and the feeling of   space inside the car. Once opened, the two roof elements are   accommodated, one on top of the other, in a compact package inside the   Roadster's trunk. The A-pillars - painted an understated black - also   underline the low-slung silhouette of the new BMW Z4, especially when   the roof is open. The optional BMW Individual hardtop - available in the   two contrast colors, Jet Black and Titanium Silver metallic - provides a   feast for the eyes when the roof is closed. The hardtop can be opened   at the touch of a button while the car is moving at up to 25 mph (40   km/h) in an automated process lasting 19 seconds.</p>
<p>The distinctive   four round headlights team up with the broad BMW kidney grille to form a   roadster-specific interpretation of the brand's signature face. The   standard Xenon headlights of the new BMW Z4 have a slim design and   extend well into the front wheel arches. They feature LED light rings   which emit daytime driving light in the brand's hallmark style. Added to   which, the light sources now have a strikingly three-dimensional design   which accentuates the intricate technology of the headlights. Cutting   across the tops of the headlights are LED accent lights, whose metal   insert bears BMW lettering. The integrated turn signal indicators have   chrome-coloured surrounds, which lend further emphasis to the   sophisticated character of the light units. Plus, a newly designed,   tapered surround for the side indicators adds a dynamic sweep to the   gills on the front side sections of the car.</p>
<h4>Striking touches: <span>new paint finishes, Hyper Orange Design package, a new alloy wheel and the M Sport package</span></h4>
<p>A   total of 11 external paint finishes are available for the new BMW Z4,   including the new Mineral Grey metallic, Glacier Silver metallic and   Valencia Orange metallic, which can only be ordered together with the   Hyper Orange package. This new aesthetic/design  package lends the   Roadster a lively aura; the interior, for example, boasts an   energy-charged contrast of black and orange. The bespoke Alcantara door   panel trim, like the lower section of the instrument panel, comes in   orange. The black leather seats have contrast stitching in Valencia   Orange and an accent stripe running down the central section of the   backrests and seat cushions. This stripe is likewise orange and is   flanked by two thin white lines. The door panel trim and lower section   of the instrument panel can also be specified in black as an option.   Another exclusive element of the Hyper Orange package is the metal weave   trim strip, which can be combined with further decorative elements in   high-gloss black for the door openers and the gearshift or selector   lever. This new Design package replaces the previously available Citrus   Yellow Package and is also available in combination with other exterior   paint colors as an option.</p>
<p>New interior additions to standard   specification include high-gloss black surrounds for the central air   vents and the iDrive control system's folding Control Display, which   comes as part of the optional navigation system. Elsewhere, exquisite   Fineline Anthracite wood has been added to the selection of interior   trim strips available as an option for the new BMW Z4. The BMW Z4   sDrive28i, BMW Z4 sDrive35i and BMW Z4 sDrive35is are offered with   Kansas leather trim. The range of light-alloy wheels includes a newly   designed V-Spoke 18-inch wheels combined with staggered front and rear   tire sizes.</p>
<p>The engaging character of the Roadster as a driver's   tool is given particular emphasis by the optional M Sport package, which   includes Adaptive M suspension, 18-inch M light-alloy wheels and an M   aerodynamics package with large air intakes in the front wing and a rear   bumper inlay painted Anthracite metallic. Bringing an extra dose of   sporting flair into the interior, meanwhile, are features such as sports   seats, an M leather steering wheel, M driver's footrest, M door sill   finishers and an anthracite-colored roof liner. The Aluminum Carbon trim   strip, M leather gear lever knob and grey dials for the instrument   cluster lend the finishing touches to the interior ambience. The new BMW   Z4 sDrive35is comes with a model-specific version of the M Sport   package.</p>
<h4>Engines: <span>BMW TwinPower Turbo technology in three output levels</span></h4>
<p>The   BMW Z4 will continue to be available in the US with one four-cylinder   and two inline-six powerplants. Their most significant shared feature is   BMW TwinPower Turbo technology, which ensures an exceptionally   effective balance between driving pleasure and fuel consumption   throughout the range.</p>
<p>The BMW sDrive28i features BMW's   award-winning TwinPower Turbo 2.0-liter four cylinder engine, which   produces 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. It powers the BMW   Roadster from 0 - 60 mph in 5.5 seconds with the 6-speed manual (5.6   with the 8-speed automatic) and returns EPA mileage estimates of 22 mpg   city/ 34 mpg highway and 26 mpg combined with the manual and 24/33/26   for the 8-speed automatic). The BMW Z4 sDrive35i features BMW's N54   TwinPower Turbo 3.0-liter inline-6, producing 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of   torque. It goes 0 - 60 mph in five seconds flat with the7-speed DCT (5.1   with the 6-speed manual) with EPA mileage estimates of 19 mpg city/ 26   mpg highway and 21 mpg combined with the manual and 17/24/19 for the   7-speed DCT. The top-range Z4 sDrive35is features a higher-output   version of BMW's venerable N54 producing 335 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque   and the 7-speed DCT. The top model goes from 0 - 60 mph in just 4.8   seconds without a penalty to the EPA mileage estimates.</p>
<h4>Extensive comfort-enhancing equipment</h4>
<p>The   new BMW Z4 delivers the driving pleasure customers have come to expect   from the brand, fulfilling the desire for both sporting ability and   comfort. Drivers can use the standard Driving Experience Control switch   to select a configuration to suit the situation at hand and satisfy   personal preferences. COMFORT, SPORT and SPORT+ modes can all be called   up using the rocker switch on the center console. As well as adjusting   the responses of the engine and DSC stability system, the different   modes also alter the shift characteristics of the automatic gearbox, the   responses of the Servotronic function and the mapping of the   electronically controlled dampers, if these items are specified. These   modes allow the driver to choose from a selection of distinctive and   clearly differentiated set-ups for the car.</p>
<p>Other items of   equipment fitted as standard are Xenon headlights, automatic climate   control, a heated glass rear window, the Soft Close Automatic function   for the boot lid and runflat tires with a tire pressure monitor. The   standard Z4 sound system includes CD player, AUX-IN socket and 11   loudspeakers. Customers can also choose the optional Premium Sound   System with higher output and 14 loudspeakers. The optional navigation   system enables high-resolution map graphics - complete with 3D view - on   the 8.8-inch iDrive monitor. The navigation data for the system is   stored on an in-car hard disk, which also provides 12 GB of capacity for   personal music collections.</p>
<p>The range of driver assistance   systems and mobility services from BMW ConnectedDrive has also expanded   once again. The new BMW Z4 can be equipped with features such as High   Beam Assistant and Park Distance Control with sensors at the front and   rear of the car. If the navigation system is specified, the   ConnectedDrive Services options allow use of internet-based information   and entertainment services inside the car. This system must be fitted to   enable access to the BMW Online portal and apps using the Control   Display and iDrive Controller. The Real Time Traffic Information   function is also on hand, supplying the driver with congestion warnings   and diversion recommendations in real time. Apple iPhone owners can use   BMW apps, for example, to receive web radio stations, display Facebook   and Twitter posts on the monitor and ask for them to be read out. BMW   Apps also enhanced safe, convenient access to music streaming services   like Pandora, MOG and Aupeo as well as Stitcher. The range of BMW   ConnectedDrive features available for the new BMW Z4 also includes BMW   TeleServices, BMW Remote Services, Concierge Services and enhanced   Automatic Collision Notification with automatic vehicle location and   accident severity detection.</p>
<h4 id="ovr">Transmission</h4>
<p>The BMW E89 Z4 35is comes exclusively with a computer-controlled overboost function. The boost function activates after every gear change with full throttle, and lasts for 7 seconds between 1500 and 4500rpm. During that time frame, the car will have reached 500Nm of torque for 1-2 seconds, an increase of 50Nm (37lb-ft) over the 450Nm (332lb-ft) without overboost. The full 500Nm comes in 3rd-7th gear only.
