<p>The Porsche 918 Spyder embodies the essence of the Porsche idea, combining pedigree motor racing technology with excellent everyday suitability, and maximum performance with minimum consumption. The début of the 918 Spyder at the IAA 2013 marks the start of a new chapter in the future of the hybrid drive.
</p> 
<p>And the technology pioneers are not the only ones who are excited by   this flagship project, as the 918 Spyder demonstrates the potential of   the hybrid drive to a degree never seen before, achieving a parallel   improvement in both fuel efficiency and performance without compromising   on either. This is the idea that has made the Porsche 911 the most   successful sportscar in the world for the past 50 years. In short, the   918 Spyder contains the genetic blueprint for the Porsche sportscar of   the future.</p>
<p>The Porsche 918 Spyder has been greatly influenced by   its affiliations with motorsport. A number of the developments to the   Porsche race car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans 2014 were used in the 918   Spyder - and vice versa. The structural concept, which is based on a   rolling chassis (i.e. a chassis without bodywork), is standard for   Porsche race cars. The design of the V8 engine is based on that of the   Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) race car, the RS Spyder, and the supporting   monocoque structures and unit carriers are made from carbon fibre   reinforced plastic (CFRP). More importantly, however, the Porsche 918   Spyder is considerably more fuel efficient than any of its competitors.   In fact, this plug-in hybrid combines the performance of a race car with   an output of over 880 bhp with an estimated NEDC fuel consumption of   just three litres per 100 km, which is lower than the majority of   today's compact cars. Drivers can therefore enjoy maximum driving   pleasure and minimum fuel consumption.</p>
<h4>Hybrid drive enhances dynamic performance</h4>
<p>The   core message surrounding the 918 Spyder is that the Porsche hybrid drive   offers uncompromising dynamic performance. The unique all-wheel drive   concept with a combined combustion engine and electric motor drive   system on the rear axle and a second electric motor on the front axle   make this possible. This concept is based on Porsche's motorsport   development work for the successful 911 GT3 R hybrid.</p>
<p>The   additional, individually controllable front-wheel drive enables new   driving strategies to be used for extremely high yet safe speeds through   bends in particular. What's more, the advanced &quot;boost&quot; strategy manages   the energy of the electric drive so intelligently that the unrestricted   total power of the 918 Spyder can be accessed simply by fully   depressing the accelerator pedal for every burst of speed at maximum   acceleration. In short, the Porsche 918 Spyder allows even drivers   without motorsport training to experience the potential of advanced   longitudinal and lateral dynamics.</p>
<h4>From comfortable to race-ready: <span>Five modes for three motors</span></h4>
<p>The   centrepiece of the 918 Spyder concept is the distribution of propulsive   power across three power units, all of which are integrated and   controlled via an intelligent management system. To benefit as much as   possible from the coverage offered by the different systems, the Porsche   developers have defined a total of five operating modes, which can be   activated via a map switch in the steering wheel, just like in race   cars. Using the pre-selected mode, the 918 Spyder applies the most   suitable operating and boost strategy without any further intervention   from drivers, thus allowing them to concentrate fully on the road.</p>
<h4>Quiet and elegant: <span>&quot;E-Power&quot;</span></h4>
<p>When   the vehicle is started up, &quot;E-Power&quot; mode is selected as the default   operating mode, provided that the battery is sufficiently charged.   Depending on load, the 918 Spyder can cover between 16 and 32 kilometres   on purely electric power. Even in pure electric mode, the Porsche 918   Spyder accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in under seven seconds and can   reach speeds of up to 150 km/h. In this mode, the combustion engine is   used only when needed. If the battery charging condition drops below a   set minimum level, the vehicle automatically switches to hybrid mode.</p>
<h4>Efficient and comfortable: <span>&quot;Hybrid&quot;</span></h4>
<p>In   &quot;Hybrid&quot; mode, the electric motors and combustion engine work   alternately, focusing on achieving maximum efficiency and minimum fuel   consumption. The power output of the individual drive components is   modified in line with the current driving situation and the required   performance level. Hybrid mode is typically used for fuel-efficient   driving.</p>
<h4>Sporty and dynamic: <span>&quot;Sport Hybrid&quot;</span></h4>
<p>If   a more dynamic performance is required, the power units in the 918   Spyder switch over to &quot;Sport Hybrid&quot; mode. The combustion engine now   operates continuously, representing the main propulsive force. The   electric motors are activated to support acceleration through the   electric boost function, or at points when the operating point of the   combustion engine can be optimised for greater efficiency. This mode   focuses on performance and a sporty driving experience at top speeds.</p>
<h4>For fast laps: <span>&quot;Race Hybrid&quot;</span></h4>
<p>&quot;Race   Hybrid&quot; is the mode for maximum performance combined with an especially   sporty driving experience. The combustion engine is chiefly used under   high load, and charges the battery whenever the driver does not require   maximum power. The electric motors provide additional support in the   form of boosting in this mode too. The gearshift programme of the   Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) is also designed for even sportier driving.   The electric motors are used up to the maximum power output limit to   deliver the best possible performance for the race track. In this mode,   the battery charging condition is not kept constant and instead   fluctuates over the entire charge range. In contrast to Sport Hybrid   mode, the electric motors run at their maximum power output limit for a   short period for enhanced boost performance. This increased output is   balanced out by the fact that the combustion engine charges the battery   more intensively. The electric power boost is thus always available to   the driver even for several very fast laps.</p>
<h4>For pole position:<span> &quot;Hot Lap&quot;</span></h4>
<p>The   &quot;Hot Lap&quot; button in the centre of the map switch releases the 918   Spyder's final reserves and can only be activated in &quot;Race Hybrid&quot; mode.   Similar to a qualification mode, &quot;Race Hybrid&quot; mode pushes the traction   battery to its maximum power output limits for a few fast laps. This   mode uses all of the available energy in the battery.</p>
<h4>A drive that harnesses the power of three separate power units</h4>
<p>The   main drive source is the 4.6-litre, eight-cylinder engine with an   output of up to 608 bhp. Based on the power unit of the successful RS   Spyder endurance race car, the engine delivers engine speeds of up to   9150 rpm and a power output per litre of approx. 132 bhp/litre - 26   bhp/litre more than that of the <a href="carreragt" title="Porsche Carrera GT (2004)">Carrera GT</a>, making this the highest specific power of any naturally aspirated Porsche engine.</p>
<p>And   it is not just the performance of the 918 Spyder engine that stirs up   an emotive response: The sound of this vehicle is just as impressive,   and can primarily be attributed to the &quot;top pipes&quot; - exhaust tailpipes   that terminate directly above the engine in the upper part of the rear   end. No other series production vehicle features this solution.</p>
<h4>In parallel in the drivetrain: <span>Hybrid module</span></h4>
<p>The   V8 engine is coupled to the hybrid module as the Porsche 918 Spyder is   designed as a parallel hybrid like Porsche's current hybrid models. The   hybrid module essentially comprises a 115-kW electric motor and a   decoupler that serves as the connection with the combustion engine.   Because of its parallel hybrid configuration, the 918 Spyder can be   powered at the rear axle either individually by the combustion engine or   the electric motor, or via both drives together. As is typical for a   Porsche super sportscar, the power unit assembly in the 918 Spyder has   been placed in front of the rear axle, and it does not have a direct   mechanical connection to the front axle. A seven-speed Porsche   Doppelkupplung (PDK) transmission handles power transmission to the rear   axle.</p>
<h4>Independent all-wheel drive: <span>Front axle with electric motor</span></h4>
<p>There   is another independent electric motor that generates approximately 95   kW of power at the front axle. The front electric drive unit drives the   wheels at a fixed gear ratio. A decoupler decouples the electric motor   at high speeds to prevent the motor from over-revving. The drive torque   is independently controlled for each axle, creating a very responsive   all-wheel drive function with significant potential in terms of traction   and dynamic performance.</p>
<h4>Lithium-ion battery with plug-in charging system</h4>
<p>The   electric energy for the electric motors is stored by a liquid-cooled   lithium-ion battery comprising 312 individual cells with an energy   content of approximately seven kilowatt hours. The battery in the   Porsche 918 Spyder has a performance-oriented design in terms of both   power charging and output, enabling it to meet the performance   requirements of the electric motor. The power capacity and operating   life of the lithium-ion traction battery depend on several factors,   including thermal conditions. This is why the 918 Spyder's battery is   liquid cooled by a dedicated cooling circuit. The global warranty period   for the traction battery is seven years.</p>
<p>Porsche has developed a   new system with a plug-in charging interface and improved recuperation   potential for charging the battery. For example, on the German 230 Volt   mains supply, the traction battery can be charged within four hours by   connecting the Porsche Universal Charger (AC) provided in the scope of   delivery to a ten-ampere fused power socket. The Porsche Speed Charging   Station (DC) is also available as an option, and will fully charge the   high-voltage battery in just under 25 minutes.</p>
<h4>Chassis with race car genes and rear-axle steering</h4>
<p>The   Porsche 918 Spyder's multi-link chassis was inspired by motorsport   design, and is complemented by additional systems such as the Porsche   Active Suspension Management (PASM) adaptive shock-absorber system and   rear-axle steering, which is essentially an electro-mechanical   adjustment system at each rear wheel. This adjustment is   speed-sensitive, providing steering angles of up to three degrees in   each direction.</p>
<p>The rear axle can therefore be steered in the same   direction or in the opposite direction to the front wheels. At low   speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to   the front wheels, which has the effect of shortening the wheelbase. This   makes cornering even more direct, faster and more precise, and reduces   the turning circle. At higher speeds, the system steers the rear wheels   in the same direction as the front wheels, which has the effect of   lengthening the wheelbase. This significantly increases rear end   stability when changing lanes quickly, resulting in exceptionally safe   and stable handling.</p>
<h4>The tyres of the 918: <span>A special challenge</span></h4>
<p>On   the one hand, the tyres needed to have optimum grip and razor-sharp   handling on all road types. On the other hand, the tyres needed to be   durable on the racetrack and have as low a rolling resistance as   possible. As a result, the developers of the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2   tyres for the Porsche 918 Spyder were faced with a seemingly   insurmountable conflict of objectives. However, working closely with   Porsche engineers, the tyre experts from Michelin were able to overcome   this challenge in impressive fashion: The 918 Spyder is rolling out of   production facilities exclusively on specially tuned Michelin Pilot   Sport Cup 2 tyres. A total of 550 prototype tyres were produced and   tested over the course of the testing period. 400 preproduction   prototypes and 200 series test specimens were also produced before   Porsche gave the final approval for the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres   in size 265/35 ZR 20 for the front axle and 325/30 ZR 21 for the rear   axle. The tyres developed specially for the Porsche 918 are also raising   the benchmark in the ultra sports tyre segment when it comes to driving   on wet surfaces and in terms of aquaplaning safety. The Porsche 918   sees this exclusive partnership between Michelin and Porsche in the   development of special tyres for super sportscars entering its second   phase. This partnership started more than ten years ago with the Carrera   GT.</p>
<h4>The Weissach package for an even better performance</h4>
<p>For   customers looking for an even better performance from the 918 Spyder,   Porsche also offers the &quot;Weissach&quot; package. Super sportscars modified   with this package are also available in special colours and designs   inspired by legendary Porsche race cars, making them instantly   recognisable. The emphasis on performance is not just visual: Super   lightweight magnesium wheels reduce the unsprung weight, decreasing the   gross weight by around 35 kg. These lightweight features are decisive   when it comes to further enhancing the dynamic performance of the   vehicle. Other references to motorsport include six-point seatbelts for   the driver and front passenger, an optional film coating instead of a   paint finish, plus additional aerodynamic add-on parts in visible carbon   fibre.</p>
<h4>Porsche Active Aerodynamic (PAA) for different driving modes</h4>
<p>Porsche   Active Aerodynamic (PAA) is a system of adjustable aerodynamic elements   that provides a unique and variable aerodynamic response. The system   works in three stages, switching automatically between optimum   efficiency and maximum downforce, and working in harmony with the   operating modes of the hybrid drive.</p>
<p>In &quot;Race&quot; mode, the   retractable rear wing is set to a steep angle to generate high downforce   at the rear axle. The spoiler, which is positioned between the two wing   supports at the trailing edge of the airflow, also extends. Two   adjustable air flaps are opened in the underbody in front of the front   axle, directing some of the air into the diffuser channels of the   underbody structure to also produce a &quot;ground effect&quot; at the front axle.</p>
<p>In   &quot;Sport&quot; mode, the aerodynamics control system reduces the approach   angle of the rear wing slightly, enabling a higher top speed. The   spoiler remains extended but the aerodynamic flaps in the underbody   close, which also reduces aerodynamic drag and increases the potential   vehicle speed. In &quot;E&quot; mode, the system focuses solely on low aerodynamic   drag; the rear wing and spoiler are retracted and the underbody flaps   are closed. Adjustable air intakes under the main headlights round off   the adaptive aerodynamics system. When the vehicle is stationary and in   &quot;Race&quot; or &quot;Sport&quot; mode, the intakes are opened to enable maximum   cooling. In &quot;E-Power&quot; and &quot;Hybrid&quot; mode, the air intakes close as soon   as the vehicle is driven off in order to keep aerodynamic drag to a   minimum. They are not opened again until the vehicle reaches speeds of   approximately 130 km/h or when cooling requirements are higher.</p>
<h4>Clear organisation in the cockpit</h4>
<p>The   driver is the focus behind all the technology in the future Porsche   super sportscar. With this in mind, the engineers have developed a   cockpit that is typical of the brand and pioneering in its clarity. The   cockpit concept is divided into two basic sections: The first section   comprises the controls that are important for driving. These items are   grouped around the multi-function steering wheel and combined with   driver information displayed on three large round instruments. The   second section comprises the infotainment block housed in the elevated   centre console, which was originally introduced in the Carrera GT.</p>
<p>Systems   like climate control, wing adjustment, lighting and the Porsche   Communication Management (PCM) system along with the Burmester High-End   sound system can be operated intuitively via the multi-touch control   functions on the innovative black panel display.</p>
<h4>A unique open-roof driving experience: <span>Removable roof panels</span></h4>
<p>As   a super sportscar designed for everyday use, the Porsche 918 Spyder   offers a spectacular top-down driving experience. The two roof panels   made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) are removable, as is   the tradition at Porsche, and can be stored securely in the 100-litre   luggage compartment located at the front of the vehicle.</p>
<h4>Porsche redefined:<span> A new super sportscar for a new decade</span></h4>
<p>The   918 Spyder continues a long tradition of super sportscars at Porsche.   Many of these vehicles have set technological benchmarks and have become   the ultimate sportscars of their decades: the Carrera GTS, the first   Porsche Turbo, the 959,   the 911 GT1 and the Carrera GT. More so than any of its predecessors,   the 918 Spyder is providing the key momentum for developing technologies   for future vehicle concepts. The Porsche 918 Spyder features all the   components that reflect the Porsche DNA in a format that is more   powerful than ever before.</p>
