<p>With the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Automobili Lamborghini is   redefining the very pinnacle of the world super sports car market -   brutal power, outstanding lightweight engineering and phenomenal   handling precision are combined with peerless design and the very finest   equipment to deliver an unparalleled driving experience. With the   Aventador, Lamborghini is taking a big step into the future - and   building on the glorious history of the brand with the next automotive   legend. The first customers will take delivery of the new Lamborghini   Aventador LP700-4 in late summer 2011.</p>
<p>The technology package of   the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 is utterly unique. It is based on an   innovative monocoque made from carbon-fiber that combines exceptional   lightweight engineering with the highest levels of stiffness and safety.   The new twelve-cylinder with 6.5 liters' displacement and 515 kW / 700   hp brings together the ultimate in high-revving pleasure with   astonishing low-end torque. Thanks to a dry weight of only 1,575   kilograms (3,472 lb), which is extremely low for this class of vehicle,   the weight-to-power ratio stands at only 2.25 kilograms per hp (4.96   lb/hp). Even the fantastic 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration figure of   just 2.9 seconds and the top speed of 350 km/h (217 mph) do not fully   describe the Aventador's extreme performance. And yet, fuel consumption   and CO2 emissions are down by around 20 percent compared with its   predecessor, despite the considerable increase in power (+8%).</p>
<p>The ISR transmission is unique among road-going vehicles,   guaranteeing the fastest shifting time (only 50 milliseconds) and a   highly emotional shift feel, while the lightweight chassis with pushrod   suspension delivers absolute handling precision and competition-level   performance. The expressively-designed interior offers hi-tech features   ranging from the TFT cockpit display with Drive Select Mode system. The   Aventador will be built to the very highest quality standards in an   all-new production facility in Sant'Agata Bolognese.</p>
<p>&quot;With the   Aventador LP700-4, the future of the super sports car is now part of the   present. Its exceptional package of innovative technologies is unique,   its performance simply overwhelming,&quot; says Stephan Winkelmann, President   and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini. &quot;The Aventador is a jump of two   generations in terms of design and technology, it's the result of an   entirely new project, but at the same time it's a direct and consistent   continuation of Lamborghini's brand values. It is extreme in its design   and its performance, uncompromising in its standards and technology, and   unmistakably Italian in its style and perfection. Overall, the dynamics   and technical excellence of the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 makes it   unrivalled in the worldwide super sports car arena.&quot;</p>
<h4>Aventador: the name of one of the most courageous of all bulls</h4>
<p>According   to its tradition, Lamborghini's new flagship bears the name of a bull -   naturally, a particularly courageous specimen from the world of the   Spanish Corrida. Aventador was the name of a bull that entered into   battle in October 1993 at the Saragossa Arena, earning the &quot;Trofeo de la   Peña La Madroñera&quot; for its outstanding courage.</p>
<h4>A sculpture of extreme dynamics</h4>
<p>For   Lamborghini, design is always the beauty of aggressive power, the   elegance of breathtaking dynamics. From the very first glance, the new   Aventador is unmistakably a Lamborghini, clothed in the brand's   characteristic and distinctive design language - with its extremely   powerful proportions, its exact lines and precise surfaces, and with   taut muscularity in every one of its details. The designers in the   Centro Stile Lamborghini have carefully developed this design language   to give the Lamborghini Aventador a significant new edge. It is an   avantgarde work of art, an incredibly dynamic sculpture, from the   sharply honed front end through the extremely low roofline to the   distinctive rear diffuser. Every line has a clear function, every form   is dictated by its need for speed, yet the overall look is nothing less   than spectacular and breathtaking.</p>
<h4>The doors open upward - of course</h4>
<p>Truly   impressive proportions come from an overall length of 4,78 meters   (188.19 in.) matched with an impressive width of 2,26 meters (88.98 in.)   including the exterior mirrors, and further accentuated by an extremely   low height of just 1.136 mm (44.72 in.). It goes without saying that   both doors of the carbon-fiber monocoque open upward - a feature that   was first introduced in the now legendary Countach and then used for   subsequent V12 models such as Diablo and Murciélago.   However, the Aventador also evokes its immediate predecessor the   Murciélago - electronically managed air intakes open depending on the   outdoor temperature and the need for cooling air,ensuring maximum   aerodynamic efficiency. And for those whishing to flaunt the heart of   their Lamborghini, the optional transparent engine bonnet exhibits the   twelve-cylinder engine like a technical work of art in a display case.</p>
<h4>Exclusive and high-tech interior</h4>
<p>The   Aventador's spacious interior combines the fine exclusivity of premium   materials and perfect Italian craftsmanship with state-of-the-art   technology and generous equipment. The red switch cover on the broad   center tunnel encloses the start button used to awaken the   twelve-cylinder. The interior is dominated by a next-generation   dashboard - as in a modern airplane, the instruments are presented on a   TFT-LCD screen using innovative display concepts. A second screen is   dedicated to the standard-fit multimedia and navigation system.</p>
<h4>Carbon-fiber monocoque</h4>
<p>The   new Lamborghini flagship has a full monocoque. The entire occupant   cell, with tub and roof, is one single physical component. This ensures   extreme rigidity and thus outstanding driving precision, as well as an   extremely high level of passive safety for the driver and his passenger.   The entire monocoque weighs only 147.5 kilograms (325.18 lb).</p>
<p>The   monocoque, together with the front and rear Aluminium frames, features   an impressive combination of extreme torsional stiffness of 35,000   Newton meters per degree and weighs only 229.5 kilograms (505.9 lb).</p>
<h4>Maximum revs, amazing sound</h4>
<p>For   the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, the engineers in Lamborghini's   R&amp;D Department have developed a completely new high-performance   power unit - an extremely powerful and high-revving, but very compact   power unit. At 235 kilograms (518 lb), it is also extremely lightweight.   A V12 with 515 kW (700 hp) at 8,250 rpm sets a whole new benchmark,   even in the world of super sports cars. The maximum torque output is 690   Newton meters (509 lb-ft) at 5,500 rpm. The extremely well-rounded   torque curve, the bull-like pulling power in every situation, the   spontaneous responsiveness and, last but not least, the finely modulated   but always highly emotional acoustics are what make this engine a   stunning power plant of the very highest order.</p>
<h4>Innovative transmission for maximum performance</h4>
<p>Engineers   at Lamborghini have created the perfect mate for the new   twelve-cylinder engine with the highly innovative ISR (Independent   Shifting Rods) transmission. The development objective was clearly   formulated - to build not only the fastest robotized gearbox, but also   to create the world's most emotional gear shift. Compared with a   dual-clutch transmission, not only is the ISR gearbox much lighter, it   also has smaller dimensions than a conventional manual unit - both key   elements in the field of lightweight engineering for super sports cars.</p>
<h4>Refined and safe with all-wheel drive</h4>
<p>This   kind of extreme power must be delivered reliably to the road. The   driver of the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 can depend fully on its   permanent all-wheel drive - indicated by the 4 in the model designation.   In the driveline, an electronically controlled Haldex coupling   distributes the forces between front and rear. In a matter of   milliseconds, this coupling adapts the force distribution to match the   dynamic situation. A self-blocking rear differential together with a   front differential electronically controlled by ESP make for even more   dynamic handling. The Drive Select Mode System enables the driver to   choose vehicle characteristics (engine, transmission, differential,   steering and dynamic control) from three settings - Strada (road), Sport   and Corsa (track) - to suit his individual preferences.</p>
<h4>Pushrod suspension</h4>
<p>Lamborghini   has equipped its new V12 super sports car with an innovative and highly   sophisticated suspension concept. The pushrod spring and damper concept   was inspired by Formula 1 and tuned perfectly to meet the needs of a   high-performance road-going vehicle. Together with aluminum double   wishbone suspension and a carbon-fiber ceramic brake system, this   lightweight chassis represents a further aspect of the new flagship's   unique technology concept.</p>
<h4>Extensive assistance and safety systems</h4>
<p>In   the hands of its driver, the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 is a   high-precision machine - spontaneous, direct and always reliable. The   driver is also assisted by the latest electronic systems such as the   incredibly sporty, adjustable ESP system. When it comes to passive   safety, front, head-thorax and knee airbags play their part alongside   the extremely stiff carbon-fiber cell.</p>
<h4>A rich and wide-ranging individualization program</h4>
<p>A   Lamborghini should always fit perfectly with the style and preferences   of its owner. To this end, the range of individualization options is   virtually inexhaustible. There is a selection of 13 production paint   colors to choose from, three of which are highly sophisticated matt   tones. A choice of two-tone interiors are offered with the &quot;Sportivo&quot;   and &quot;Elegante&quot; versions, while a premium audio system and reversing   camera are among the many technology options. And of course, the &quot;Ad   Personam&quot; individualization program knows no limits when it comes to   colors and materials.</p>
<h4>The Design</h4>
<p>Every   Lamborghini is an avantgarde work of art, a fast-moving technical   sculpture. Every line, every detail of a super sports car from   Sant'Agata is derived from its function - namely speed, dynamics,   performance. Every Lamborghini is a purist's dream, reduced to its very   essence.</p>
<p>With the new Aventador LP700-4, the designers at the   Centro Stile Lamborghini in Sant'Agata Bolognese have taken this   committed philosophy to a whole new level - its extreme, razor-sharp   lines portray a precision that is without parallel in automotive design.   And its clean, taut and expertly executed surfaces demonstrate the   exceptional competence and depth of experience possessed by Lamborghini   in carbon-fiber body shell design.</p>
<p>The surface of the roof has a   new geometry that provides greater spaciousness for the passengers while   at the same time giving relief to the lines of the front section. This   also addresses the aim of obtaining a better aerodynamic coefficient,   continuing Lamborghini's design philosophy of 'form follows function'.</p>
<p>The engine cover utilizes the same styling giving continuity to the concept.</p>
<h4>Inspiration from aeronautics</h4>
<p>For   the further development of the Lamborghini design language, designers   pulled their inspiration from another sphere dominated by speed and   dynamics - from modern aeronautics, from the world's fastest and most   agile aircraft. This gave rise to a design of maximum functionality and   spectacular sharpness, an extremely precise and highly technical design   language with a new kind of vitality. Powerfully defined lines and taut   surfaces create a fascinating interplay of light and shade, endowing the   car with tremendous visual movement. The limited edition Reventón - a   work of automotive art - and the Sesto Elemento 'technology   demonstrator' were forerunners of this philosophy: the Aventador is the   first Lamborghini series production car embodying this vision.</p>
<p>The   Aventador, of course, also follows the mid-engine concept, with the   vehicle weight concentrated around the vertical axis to reduce inertia   and optimize dynamics. With the legendary Countach, Lamborghini was a   pioneer of mid-engine construction, its revolutionary concept bringing   racing technology to the road. The design of the Lamborghini Aventador   adds visual emphasis to the mid-engine layout, with a look that   concentrates its power on the rear axle.</p>
<h4>Aerodynamic efficiency is crucial</h4>
<p>For   such an extremely powerful automobile, the most crucial task of the   body shell design is aerodynamic efficiency: the optimum airflow for   absolute stability at all speeds and, at the same time, optimum cooling   for the engine. On the Aventador, all aerodynamic elements are   integrated into the body shell form, from the front spoiler to the rear   diffuser. A key role is played by the flat, optimized underbody. The   rear spoiler is deployable and controlled electronically. At rest, it   lies flush with the rear of the vehicle; in operation, it has two   positions - the approach angle of 4 degrees is optimized for high speed   and assists directional stability at the very top end of the spectrum.   The tilt of 11 degrees, on the other hand, delivers considerably greater   downforce at mid-range speeds, helping to optimize handling and   stability. The car uses dynamic parameters to calculate for itself the   most appropriate tilt angle.</p>
<h4>Impressive proportions, mighty air intakes</h4>
<p>The   first striking impression of the Lamborghini Aventador focuses on its   proportions. At a length of 4.78 meters (188.19 in.), it is a truly   impressive 2.26 meters (88.98 in.) wide including exterior mirrors, but   only 1,136 meters (44.72 in.) high. The impression of width is further   emphasized by the widely spaced air intakes and headlamp units.</p>
<p>The   Aventador's incredibly low front takes on a distinct arrow form, with   the Lamborghini bull insignia gracing both the point and the center   line, which continues its path along the entire length of the vehicle.   The air guides are powerfully profiled and further emphasized by their   glossy, black frames. The bi-xenon headlamps are clustered with the LED   units for daytime running lights and indicators beneath hexagonal   casings. The daytime running light comes from LED light guides that wrap   around the main headlamp in a Y form. Seven further LEDs provide the   light source for the indicator.</p>
<h4>Two strokes define the side line</h4>
<p>The   extremely long side view is dominated by the very low roofline and by   two sweeping strokes - the first emphasizes the front wheel arch; the   second, very sharply drawn line begins at the front wheel arch and runs   like a tensed muscle along the entire side of the car and over the rear   wheel. The deeply recessed door and the mighty sill bear further   testimony to the determined functionality of the Lamborghini design.   Ultimately, these forms serve only one purpose - to deliver the maximum   volume of cooling air to the mighty V12 power plant. The large air   intakes behind the upward-opening doors are also enclosed in black   plastic frames and guarded by a fine mesh. The engine air intake is   located on the roof pillar, behind the third side window. And when   cooling requirements are particularly high, additional air channels open   up on the rear wheel arches.</p>
<p>The rear end, too, is dominated by   openings framed in black, where the hot air finds its exit. The entire   rear end is highly three-dimensional in its design. The lower diffuser   stands in powerful relief, while the substantial format of the hexagonal   tail pipe symbolizes the concentrated potency of the engine. The rear   lights in LED technology reiterate the triple Y motive already familiar   from current Lamborghini models.</p>
<h4>V12 as an object of technical beauty</h4>
<p>Equally   familiar is the transparent engine bonnet (option), which adds a   particularly attractive dimension to the many emotional perspectives on   the Aventador. The twelve-cylinder power unit, with its mighty black   intake manifold, lies in all its technical glory beneath the three cover   panels. It is framed by diagonal carbon-fiber struts and accompanied by   the powerful dampers from the pushrod suspensions.</p>
<p>The design   philosophy continues into the surprisingly roomy interior. The cockpit   is upholstered entirely in fine leather and also takes on a subtle arrow   form. The controls are logically grouped on the broad center console.   Here, too, the inspiration derived from aviation is immediately apparent   - as in modern aircraft, the instruments are presented on a TFT-LCD   screen. At the center of the display is a large dial - at the touch of a   button, the driver can choose whether he would rather see the road   speed read-out or the engine speed. Further information ranging from   fuel level to the output from the on-board computer is grouped in fields   surrounding the large dial.</p>
<h4>The operating system</h4>
<p>The   most important switch is hidden beneath a red switch cover - the start   button, which instantly fires the high-performance engine into life.</p>
<p>A   second, seven-inch TFT-LCD screen in the center console belongs to the   integrated multimedia system. Beneath it is the familiar array of   Lamborghini toggle switches for operating functions such as the electric   windows or the front axle lifting system, as well as the controls for   the air conditioning.</p>
<p>The Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 offers a   state-of-the-art and comprehensive lineup of electronic vehicle,   entertainment and communication systems. These functions are operated in   a clear and intuitive manner via the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) on   the center console, featuring a large push/turn control and eight   function keys.</p>
<h4>The carbon-fiber monocoque of the Lamborghini Aventador</h4>
<p>Lamborghini   is heading into the future with a systematic lightweight design concept   - the intensive application of carbon-fiber materials forms the key   foundation for the extreme dynamics of the new Aventador LP700-4. The   new flagship is based on a full monocoque construction made with these   innovative materials - conceived and produced entirely by Automobili   Lamborghini in Sant'Agata Bolognese.</p>
<p>This development sees   Lamborghini once again demonstrate its worldwide leading expertise in   carbon-fiber technology. The super sports car brand from Sant'Agata   Bolognese is the only automaker to have fully mastered the extensive   CFRP process across a range of technologies in-house - from 3D design,   through simulation, test, production and validation using   state-of-the-art industrial processes to the very highest quality   standards. With the Aventador, Lamborghini is putting its innovative,   in-house developed and patented technologies into series production for   the first time.</p>
<p>The cell of the future Lamborghini flagship super   sports car is made entirely from carbon fiber and has been designed as a   monocoque structure. The load-bearing structure of the vehicle is   engineered as a &quot;single shell&quot; that functions physically as one   component, thus taking full advantage of the extreme rigidity of CFRP.   Formula 1 race cars have been built using CFRP monocoques for many years   - and have proven their crash worthiness time and again. The same   applies to road-going sports cars featuring monocoque technology - the   carbon fiber occupant cell functions like an extremely safe roll cage.</p>
<h4>Construction offers many advantages</h4>
<p>Of   course, the term &quot;single shell&quot; applies only in the descriptive sense -   the new Lamborghini monocoque is made from a series of individual parts   with specific functions and technologies, such as stiffening elements   made from Braiding technology, that is one of the best technology to   manage energy adsorption in case of crash. After the curing process,   however, this structure functions as a single component - including the   base section known as the tub and the complete roof.</p>
<p>The full   monocoque solution offers advantages which other processes, like a tub   where a metal roof structure is attached in a conventional manner,   cannot realize. That's why Lamborghini made the no compromise choice of   the full monocoque, which weighs only 147.5 kilograms (324.5 lbs).</p>
<h4>Extremely rigid construction</h4>
<p>Superior   passive safety is only one benefit of the extreme rigidity of a full   carbon fiber monocoque - very high torsional rigidity is another. The   monocoque is connected at the front and rear with equally rigid aluminum   sub-frames, on which the suspension, engine and transmission are   mounted.</p>
<p>The entire body-in-white of the future V12 model weighs   only 229.5 kilograms (505 lbs) and boasts phenomenal torsional rigidity   of 35,000 Newton meters per degree of twist. This guarantees a superb   feeling of solidity, but, more importantly, extremely exact wheel   control with excellent steering precision and sensitive feedback. For   the dedicated driver, both are essential for truly enticing driving   pleasure. The new Lamborghini flagship responds to the most minute   steering input with the stunning precision of a perfectly balanced race   car.</p>
<p>Depending on the form, function and requirements of the   individual elements, the Lamborghini development team selected from   three main CFRP manufacturing methods within its technology tool kit.   They differ not only in their production processes, but also in the type   of carbon fiber and its weave and, most importantly, in the chemical   composition of the synthetic resin used.</p>
<p>Resin Transfer Moulding   (RTM): In this process the carbon fiber mats are preformed and   impregnated with an exact amount of resin. Afterwards, they are cured   under heat while the part is in the mould. Lamborghini has achieved a   major breakthrough by further developing this method. Using the patented   &quot;RTM-Lambo&quot; process, the final mould is no longer a heavy, complex   metal piece, but is made instead from lightweight carbon-fiber parts,   thus making the manufacturing process faster, more flexible and more   efficient.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of the RTM-Lambo process is the low injection pressure that doesn't require expensive equipment.</p>
<p>Prepreg   - The carbon fiber mats used in this method, commonly known as prepreg,   are pre-injected by the supplier with a thermosetting liquid resin and   must be stored at a low temperature. The mats are then laminated in   molds and cured under heat and pressure in an autoclave. Prepreg   components are complex to make, but have an extremely high-quality   surface finish (Class-A surface quality) and are therefore the preferred   option for use in visible locations.</p>
<p>Braiding - These components   are manufactured by using RTM technology. This carbon fiber weave   technology is derived from the textile industry and used to make tubular   components for special applications such as structural roof pillars and   rocker panels. The woven components are made by diagonally interweaving   the fiber in several layers.</p>
<p>The monocoque of the new V12 super   sports car is constructed using these technologies applied in a series   of special processes. One significant advancement Lamborghini realized   is the ability to use already-assembled monocoque elements as the mould   for the next step in the process. This makes for a considerable   simplification of the manufacturing process compared with conventional   methods.</p>
<p>Epoxy foam components are also used within the monocoque.   They are placed in strategic points to increase the stiffness of the   monocoque by working as spacers between the composite layers while also   dampening noise and vibration. In addition, aluminum inserts are   laminated into the front and rear surfaces to facilitate connection with   the aluminum front and rear sub-frame elements.</p>
<p>Because of the   complexity of the materials and process outlined above, Lamborghini   decided to produce its new monocoque completely in-house, managing one   strategic step in the production process.</p>
<p>Quality control is an   absolutely crucial factor - every single monocoque is measured to   exacting tolerances of only 0.1 millimeters, facilitating the extreme   precision of the overall vehicle. Quality control starts with the   purchase of the carbon fiber parts. Every delivery of carbon fiber is   certified and the material is checked regularly for compliance with   quality standards. Lamborghini worked together with its suppliers to   develop a world-exclusive fiber and resin system for its RTM technology.   Ultimately, these materials and processes constitute an important part   of Lamborghini's worldwide leading expertise in the field.</p>
<h4>Carbon composite materials - <span>A key technology for tomorrow's high-performance automotive engineering</span></h4>
<p>These   materials made from CFRP combine the lowest possible weight with   excellent material characteristics - they are very light, extremely   rigid and exceptionally precise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, CFRP materials can   also be formed into highly complex components with integrated functions.   This reduces the number of individual parts when compared to   traditional metal construction - thus enabling further weight reduction.   Lighter cars have lower fuel consumption and fewer CO2 emissions. Most   significantly, however, it improves the power-to-weight ratio - the   deciding factor in the overall feel and performance of a sports car. A   super sports car built using CFRP accelerates faster, has superior   handling and better braking.</p>
<h4>The new V12 power unit - <span>the heart of the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4</span></h4>
<p>The   twelve-cylinder is the king of the engine world and the true heart of   the Lamborghini brand. The very first model created by Feruccio   Lamborghini, the 350 GT,   made its appearance in 1964 featuring a twelve-cylinder engine that was   incredibly innovative for its day. 3.5 liter displacement and 320 hp   were the vital statistics back then - they formed the basis for ongoing   increases and further development over the decades that followed. Miura, Espada, Countach,   Diablo and, finally, Murciélago are just a few of the super sports cars   born in Sant'Agata. All of them were, and will continue to be, driven   by V12 engines - and all have long since risen to the status of   automotive legend.</p>
<p>Now the next milestone in this glorious history   appears - engineers in the Lamborghini R&amp;D Department have   developed a completely new high-performance power unit. That it would be   another twelve-cylinder was never in doubt - and not only because of   the special magic conjured up by the number twelve. The only real choice   for Lamborghini is a high-revving naturally aspirated engine - the   deeply reflexive and exceptionally powerful reaction of the automobile   to the tiniest movement of the driver's right foot is, of course, a key   part of the whole fascination inspired by a super sports car. Ten   cylinders are ideal in the displacement class around the five liter   mark, as evidenced by the highly acclaimed Gallardo engine. For the 6.5 liter displacement targeted in this case, the   perfect number is twelve. A lower number of cylinders would result in   larger and heavier pistons and con-rods, which would have a negative   impact on the engine's high-revving characteristics.</p>
<h4>Starting with a clean sheet of paper</h4>
<p>The   specification for the development of the new twelve-cylinder, known   internally as the L539, was written quickly - yet was highly demanding   in its formulation. Naturally, it had to deliver more power and torque   than its predecessor in the Murciélago, but it should also be smaller   and lighter and enable a lower center of gravity. At the end of the day,   low weight is just as important to the performance of a super sports   car as high power output. Fuel consumption and gas emissions should also   be reduced significantly.</p>
<p>So the R&amp;D team started with a   clean sheet of paper - metaphorically speaking, of course. Design and   development in Sant'Agata is conducted using state-of-the-art systems   and equipment. The outcome is a V12 with a classic cylinder bank angle   of 60 degrees, and thus an amazingly compact power package - the power   unit measures only 665 millimeters from top to bottom, including the   intake system. Its width, including the exhaust manifold, is only 848   millimeters, while its length is a mere 784 millimeters. Its weight of   235 kilograms is also respectably low - each kilogram of engine weight   corresponds to 3.0 HP maximum output.</p>
<h4>Optimized for high revving and low weight</h4>
<p>The   crankcase on the new power plant is made from an aluminum-silicon alloy   and has an open-deck construction with steel cylinder liners.   Displacement is 6,498 cm3 and cylinder spacing 103.5 millimeters, while   bore diameter measures 95 millimeters and stroke 76.4 millimeters. The   short-stroke layout is especially good for high-revving characteristics   and for low internal friction. Particular attention was also paid to the   bearings for the forged and nitride-hardened crankshaft, which weighs   in at 24.6 kilograms.</p>
<p>The two four-valve cylinder heads are   likewise made from sand-cast aluminum-silicon alloy, each weighing a   very light 21 kilograms. The twelve pistons and con-rods are,   respectively, in forged alloy and steel. The maximum piston speed at   8,250 rpm is only 21 meters per second, which is considerably less than   for the Murciélago's previous power unit. The combustion chambers were   carefully engineered to achieve optimum tumble and combustion of the   fuel/air mixture. At 11.8:1, the compression ratio is extremely high.   Inlet and outlet valve timing is electronically controlled.</p>
<h4>Sophisticated thermal management, optimized oil circulation</h4>
<p>The   thermal management of this high-performance power unit was perfected   with extensive detail engineering. Two switchable water circuits in the   engine ensure very rapid warm-up, which minimizes friction and quickly   brings the catalytic converters up to operating temperature, thus   benefiting fuel consumption and emissions. The external water coolers   are switched into the circuit only as required.</p>
<p>Absolute engine   health, even under extreme racetrack conditions with high lateral   acceleration, is guaranteed by oil circulation using a dry sump system. A   total of eight scavenger pumps suck oil out of the lower bedplate   fastened to the crankcase. Pressure and scavenging losses are thus   reduced by around 50 percent. A high-pressure oil pump maintains   lubrication, while an oil/water cooler and an oil/air radiator   constantly keep temperatures within range even under extremely high   load. A further benefit of this form of dry sump lubrication is the very   low mounting position of the engine within the sports car. The new   engine is mounted 60 millimeters lower than the V12 in the Murciélago -   with the associated benefits in respect of center of gravity and lateral   dynamics.</p>
<p>From the outside, the V12 is dominated by its intake   system - which incorporates four individual throttle valves. Life inside   the black housing is also extremely complex - the optimum intake path   for any given load and engine speed is facilitated by two flaps, several   channels and one bypass. The payback is an extremely well-rounded   torque curve and refined pulling power throughout the rev range.</p>
<h4>Mighty orchestra for twelve voices</h4>
<p>The   exhaust system, too, was afforded the undivided attention of   Lamborghini's engineers - the lowest possible gas emissions was just as   important a target as the unmistakable, spine-tingling Lamborghini   sound. The hydro-formed and thermally insulated three-into-one system   incorporates four pre-catalytic converters close to the engine and two   main catalytic converters shortly before the muffler. The casing   incorporates two separate mufflers - one low-volume, one high-volume.   Regulated by valves controlled via the engine management, they handle   all the elements of the big twelve-cylinder symphony - from a moderate   rumble when rolling through the city at low revs to the screaming   crescendo of maxed-out gear shifts.</p>
<h4>Electronics devised entirely by Lamborghini</h4>
<p>Another   highlight is the electronic engine management, which was developed in   its entirety by engineers at Lamborghini. The system consists of the   main ECU, a secondary &quot;smart actuators&quot; and two additional black boxes   that function as &quot;smart sensors&quot;. Because speed is everything for an   engine like this, some ECU control and connection functions are handled   by the smart actuators, making the ECU faster. The two smart sensors are   constantly monitoring combustion in real time - each ignition in every   cylinder. The spark plugs - each is powered by an individual ignition   coil - function as &quot;sensors&quot;; the two auxiliary control units monitor   the power signal after every ignition and can immediately identify   irregularities in the combustion process through ionization phenomena.   This data is used to continually optimize engine management, benefiting   both performance and fuel consumption.</p>
<h4>High performance in every dimension</h4>
<p>All   these technical highlights come together to create a high-performance   power unit like no other. The maximum output of 515 kW (700 hp) at 8,250   rpm is an impressive statement in itself. The maximum torque is 690   Newton meters and is available at 5,500 r/min. The extremely generous   torque curve, meaty pulling power in every situation, extremely   reflexive responses and, not least, the finely modulated but always   highly emotional acoustics make the L539 a stunning power unit for a   super sports car of the highest order. And not only was the L539   developed entirely in-house at Lamborghini, it is also built from start   to finish at company headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Highly   qualified specialists assemble the engines by hand, with every single   unit undergoing an extensive final testing and detailed calibration   program on an engine test bed.</p>
<h4>The new Lamborghini ISR   transmission (ISR: Independent Shifting Rods) - <span>Innovative   servo-actuated mechanical gearbox for maximum performance</span></h4>
<p>However,   it is not the engine alone that defines the character and driving   characteristics of a super sports car. Another key element is the   transmission. The demands are clear - the ratios must be perfectly   arrayed and enable optimum power delivery from the engine. For maximum   vehicle performance, shift times should be less than the blink of an   eye. Operation must be clear and straightforward, via two ergonomic   shift paddles behind the steering wheel. The characteristics of the   transmission must be in line with the wishes of the driver at any given   point - from smooth city cruising through to tough action on the   racetrack. And, not least, Lamborghini customers expect an emotional   shift feeling that ensures the sports car's reactions can always be felt   and understood. Thus, the development objective was clearly formulated   in this respect, too - create the world's most emotional gear shift.</p>
<p>For   all these reasons, the engineers in the R&amp;D Department opted for a   robotized gearbox as the &quot;companion&quot; of the new V12 power unit -   however, in a very special iteration: the Lamborghini ISR transmission.   This important part of the powertrain is not only much lighter in   comparison to a dual clutch transmission, it also has the compact   dimensions of a regular manual gearbox. Both weight and size advantages   are key in the process of building super sports cars.</p>
<h4>Unique engineering for super sports cars</h4>
<p>The   new unit is laid out as a two-shaft transmission with seven forward   gears and one reverse. For especially high durability, the synchronizing   rings are made from carbon-fiber - a material with which Lamborghini   has enormous experience. The short shift times are facilitated by the   special design of the transmission, known as ISR - Independent Shifting   Rod.</p>
<p>To summarize the principle - in a conventional manual   gearbox, be it automated or fully manual, the gear wheels for, say,   second and third gears are located side by side. When the driver wants   to shift gear, the shifting sleeve with synchronizer unit is moved along   the shifting rod from second gear through neutral to third gear. This   requires twice the distance and twice the time - second gear has to be   disengaged before third gear can be engaged.</p>
<h4>Short distances, fast shift times</h4>
<p>This   process is significantly shortened in the Lamborghini ISR transmission -   the gear wheels from the second and third gears are separate from each   other and the shifting sleeves are actuated by independent shifting   rods. Now the shifting process can run virtually in parallel - while one   shifting rod is disengaging one gear, the second shifting rod can   already engage the next gear. Because these movements partially overlap   and the mechanical distances are considerably shorter, this facilitates a   significant saving in shift time. Overall, the Lamborghini ISR   transmission shifts around 140 percent faster than the e.gear   transmission in the Gallardo. And that is already one of the world's   fastest automated manual gearboxes.</p>
<h4>Compact construction, low weight</h4>
<p>The   new transmission has four of these independent shifting rods, with   sensors constantly monitoring their exact positions. They are operated   via hydraulic actuators, with an extremely high system pressure of 60   bar ensuring the necessary operating speed. The system incorporates a   total of seven hydraulic valves, with pressure supplied by an electric   pump. The double-plate clutch is also hydraulically actuated. All system   components are contained within one casing. The total weight of the   transmission is only 70 kilograms - a distinct advantage, especially   compared with the significantly heavier seven-gear dual-clutch   transmissions.</p>
<h4>Five operating modes for all situations</h4>
<p>Lamborghini   drivers can choose between five operating modes: three manual (Strada,   Sport and Corsa) and two automatic (Strada-auto and Sport-auto). The   Strada mode offers highly comfort-oriented shifting, with   fully-automatic also an option. The Sport mode has a dynamic set-up in   terms of shifting points and times, while the Corsa mode delivers the   maximum shift strategy for race track driving. This mode also includes   Launch Control, the automatic function for maximum acceleration from a   standing start.</p>
<p>With the Lamborghini ISR transmission, engineers   working under the sign of the bull have devised an ingenious mate for   the new twelve-cylinder power unit. Their work has created an overall   powertrain that is absolutely unique in the world of super sports cars.</p>
<h4>Integrated electronic control system</h4>
<p>The   excellent performances are possible only by a fast communication   architecture through the several powertrain ECU's and considering the   powertrain as ONE-system in the car.</p>
<p>The fully electronic   controlled coupling device for the front wheels (the 'old' viscous   coupling) is another key point of the powertrain: it is able to   continuously distribute the right torque to the front wheels for always   attaining the best performance aspired to by the driver. The torque   distribution to the front wheels can vary continuously from 0% to 60% of   the total torque available.</p>
<h4>Pushrod suspensions and steering</h4>
<p>The   new Lamborghini V12 super sports car features an innovative and highly   sophisticated suspension concept. The pushrod spring and damper concept   was inspired by Formula 1 and tuned perfectly to meet the needs of a   high-performance road-going vehicle. Together with aluminium double   wishbone suspensions and a carbon ceramic brake system, this lightweight   chassis is another element of the unique technology concept in   Lamborghini's new flagship model.</p>
<p>An extremely precise, indeed   razor-sharp, driving feel accurately describes the soul of the newest   and most powerful super sports car ever to bear the sign of the bull.   This includes a steering system that can think its way through a bend   adhering to the perfect line, a suspension that masters the ideal   balance between race-car feel for the road and plenty of comfort for   ramping up the miles, and lateral stability that ensures absolute safety   even at the very highest speeds.</p>
<h4>Pushrod suspension derived from motorsport</h4>
<p>With   its phenomenal engine output of 515 kW / 700 hp and its comparatively   low vehicle weight, the new V12 super sports car from Lamborghini blasts   its way to the very highest speeds. The most important characteristic   of the new suspension is its design in line with the pushrod principle -   inspired by Formula 1. The spring/damper elements are not located on   the wheel mounts, but connected inboard to the body shell structure.   They are transversely positioned: under the windscreen in the front and   close to the engine in the rear. Pushrods and relay levers / rockers   transmit the forces from the wheel mounts to the spring/damper elements.</p>
<h4>Responsive handling characteristics at all speeds</h4>
<p>This   solution offers a whole series of impressive benefits: due to the   combination of the double wishbone and pushrod arrangement, wheel   control and damper remain separate from each other. As a result,   handling is more responsive and easier to manage at all speeds, while   rigid connection to the chassis also improves the precise and   spontaneous reaction of the springs and dampers. As a result, spring   stiffness can be notched back a little - comfort increases, while   precision remains. On the front axle, the shock absorbers are equipped   with a hydraulic lifting system, which enables the front end of the   super sports car to be lifted by 40 millimeters at the touch of a   button, simplifying its ability to negotiate minor obstacles.</p>
<h4>Systematic lightweight engineering in aluminum and carbon fiber</h4>
<p>Aluminium   and carbon fiber are also the most important lightweight engineering   materials on the chassis. The entire suspension system, including upper   and lower control arms, wheel mounts and relay levers are made from   forged aluminium alloy. The large-diameter discs on the high-performance   brake system, on the other hand, are made from lightweight and   extremely hard-wearing carbon ceramic composite material. On the front   axle, the ventilated discs measure no less than 400 millimeters in   diameter, with braking force delivered via six cylinder calipers. On the   rear axle, 380 millimeter diameter discs are used in combination with   four cylinder calipers. The parking brake on the new Lamborghini top   model is electrically powered.</p>
<h4>Steering forms the sensitive connection between driver and automobile</h4>
<p>The   hydraulic steering on the Lamborghini V12 forms the highly sensitive   connection between the driver and the super sports car, which runs on   19-inch wheels clad on 255/35 tires at the front and 20-inch rims on   335/30 tires at the rear. Steering Gear foresees 3 different servotronic   characteristics managed by drive select mode.</p>
<h4>Equipment and Options</h4>
<p>The   new Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 offers the most up-to-date,   comprehensive and individualistic technology and equipment package ever   realized in a super sports car. From the dynamics through safety to   communication and entertainment, the Aventador fulfills every imaginable   desire of the most demanding sports car fan. The wide range of exterior   and interior colors and variants is perfect for individualization and,   of course, &quot;Ad Personam&quot; is also available for the Aventador for the   ultimate in personalization - where the only limits set are those of the   imagination.</p>
<p>The standard package of electronic systems includes   ABS, electronic brake distribution, anti-slip control, speed-dependent   servo-tronic steering, hill start assist and, of course, ESP stability   control. The rear spoiler and the side air intakes are electronically   controlled. The Drive Select System enables vehicle characteristics   (engine, transmission, differential, stability control, steering) to be   set in accordance with individual driver preferences in one of three   modes - Strada (road), Sport and Corsa (track).</p>
<h4>Latest Generation HMI control</h4>
<p>The   cockpit with TFT-LCD display also comes as standard, as does the   multimedia HMI system with Navigation, including traffic data, iPod   connection and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The automatic climate control functions   with a sunlight sensor, with further sensors controlling the automatic   headlights. The bi-xenon headlamps come with daytime running lights and   rear lights in LED technology.</p>
<p>The five-spoke alloy wheels are   clad in Pirelli P Zero tires and feature tire pressure monitoring, while   the brake system is equipped with carbon-ceramic rotors and black brake   calipers. Safety equipment includes six front, thorax, head and knee   airbags.</p>
<h4>Wide range of individualization options</h4>
<p>Options   include features such as the transparent engine cover, black painted   wheels and brake calipers in yellow, gray or orange. The standard audio   system can be upgraded to the &quot;High-End Lamborghini Sound System&quot; with   premium speakers featuring neodymium technology and 4 x 135 watt   amplifiers. Park assistance systems include proximity sensors front and   rear, as well as a reversing camera.</p>
<p>A range of 13 colors are   available at launch, in pastel metallic, pearlescent or matt finishes.   These include the new shades Grigio Estoque and Arancio Argos. Three   colors are available in specialized and highly sophisticated matt   finishes as AD Personam- Nero Nemesis, Bianco Canopus and Marrone Apus.</p>
<p>The   full leather single-color interior is available in either Nero Alde   (black) or in Marrone Elpis, a warm brown shade. The contrasting   stitching can be ordered in a range of colors. The two-tone leather   interiors are offered in two style lines. For Bicolor Sportivo, the base   color is black, with the contrast in orange, white, yellow or green,   while Bicolor Elegante presents a harmonious blend of brown tones. A   virtually inexhaustible array of variants is also offered by the Ad   Personam individualization program.</p>
