<p>At the 2011 Geneva Motor Show Koenigsegg is presenting the brand new   Koenigsegg Agera R - Quicker than lightning! The Agera R on the   Koenigsegg show stand - production car # 83 - is inspired by the   legendary Speed Racer theme, as specified by the owner of the car. Speed   Racers main colour is white - so is snow.  Equipped with special   Michelin tires and a custom made Thule Roof Box - Speed Racer is ready   to attack the ski resorts!</p>
<p>In 2010 Koenigsegg presented a pre-production version of the Koenigsegg Agera.   Since then the pre-production car and several test mules have continued   the Agera development program. The Agera pre-production car has been   driven by several influential motoring journals, resulting in raving   reviews and awards, such as for example becoming the &quot;Top Gear Hypercar   of the Year&quot;. Please see attached quotes from these test-drives.</p>
<p>All   in all the production versions of the Agera are created to take the   Koenigsegg experience to the next level both on the road and the track,   still maintaining the largest luggage space in the industry in   combination with the unique Koenigsegg door system and   detachable/stow-able hardtop.</p>
<p>There are several differences   between the pre-production car previously shown and the production   versions. For example, the engine and gearbox configurations are   different and some revolutionary interior, chassis and aerodynamic   features adorn the production version of the Agera that has never been   shown before. For more information, please read the full press release   below.</p>
<h4>TAKE ACTION</h4>
<p>Although sharing the same values   and philosophies as previous Koenigsegg models, the Agera takes the   Koenigsegg experience to a completely new level.</p>
<p>Similar to all   previous Koenigsegg hypercars, the new Agera is the brainchild of   Christian von Koenigsegg. The Agera has come to life in order to set new   benchmarks for Hypercars when it comes to control, handling, speed,   comfort, practicality and sheer driving enjoyment, while combining these   features with clean, efficient and beautiful design.</p>
<p>The name   Agera set the tone for the new project. Agera means &quot;to take action&quot; in   Swedish. It is also short for the ancient Greek word Ageratos which   means &quot;ageless&quot;. These two are very suitable meanings, for the car   building the future of Koenigsegg.</p>
<h4>THE DESIGN</h4>
<p>The   Agera is designed with the minimalistic &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy in   mind. This philosophy means that the shape of the car has to be purely   functional with no added features except those purely needed to meet   regulation, added safety, ergonomics, practicality and aerodynamics. We   believe that if this philosophy is followed, the car will also be   beautiful as it is purely purposeful. A good analogy is the evolution of   a dolphin that has had to meet similar criteria in order to reach their   present configuration through the evolution of nature.</p>
<p>The Agera   is proportionate, compact and muscular. Its timeless, efficient and   distinctive shape is truly a testament to time. The original shape and   concept of the Koenigsegg CC, created 15 years ago, is still valid,   fresh and highly competitive today. The Agera manage to stay true to the   original philosophy, shape and size of the original CC. At the same   time, it looks, feels and performs like something belonging to the   future.</p>
<h4>THE ENGINE</h4>
<p>Koenigsegg differs from   other low volume hypercar manufacturers by the fact that Koenigsegg   develops and produces its own engine in-house. This is, by most   observers and competitors, deemed as more or less impossible or way too   expensive to even consider.</p>
<p>However, year after year Koenigsegg   has proved them wrong. Not only are the engines developed in-house, they   also have class leading characteristics in many important areas. To   mention a few: Lightest and most compact hypercar engine in the world,   weighing only 197 kg complete with flywheel, clutch, dry sump system,   Inconel exhaust manifold with turbo. The low engine weight is quite   astonishing, as the Agera engine also has class leading power and torque   characteristics. To give an example, the Koenigsegg 5 litre V8 bi-turbo   engine develops more than 900 hp on 95 octane regular fuel, and more   than 1100 hp on E85 bio fuel. The Agera produces over 1000 Nm of torque   from 2500 rpm and in the Koenigsegg Agera R format the engine has a peak   torque of 1200 Nm over a 3300 rpm rev range, showing great flexibility.</p>
<p>These   are extraordinary numbers considering the size and reliability of the   engine without forsaking drivability or flexibility. This is truly   downsizing, without drawbacks. These characteristics make it one of the   most flexible and easy to use hypercar engines in the world.</p>
<p>To   give a hint of how different the Agera engines are compared to other   production car engines, it is easy to look at the BMEP value (Brake Mean   Effective Pressure) in the cylinders during maximum power output. The   best production diesel and petrol engines from other leading   manufacturers have a maximum BMEP of around 22 bar.</p>
<p>The Agera   engine has a BMEP of 28 bar running on 95 octane fuel and the E85 Bio   fuel Koenigsegg Agera R engines has an astonishing BMEP of 30 bar. These   numbers show how extreme the Koenigsegg engines are compared to any   other production engine in the world. The reason why Koenigsegg can   obtain such BMEP figures is due to some proprietary and critical   factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A unique shape of the combustion chambers, improving the resistance against detonation.</li>
  <li>High   cylinder head clamp load, enabled by a specially designed engine block.   This has proven to give a zero failure rate to combustion overpressure,   even considering the extreme cylinder pressures.</li>
  <li>A unique engine block design, where the cylinder sleeves are used to further stiffen the aluminium block.</li>
  <li>A connecting rod design reducing TDC dwell time and therefore enabling higher mean pressures without detonation.</li>
  <li>Exhaust manifold and intake plenum trumpets designed to ensure absence of RPM peak resonance and back pressure.</li>
  <li>An efficient ejector pump system reducing the crankcase pressure and aerodynamic losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The   Koenigsegg engines also meet all the required emission standards in the   world. This is nothing short of astounding, given their size and power   output.</p>
<p>Koenigsegg has its own engine lab, with simulation   programs, rapid prototyping machines, engine and chassis dynamometers,   and a 1.7 km test track adjacent the factory enabling Koenigsegg to take   the cars to 0-320-0 km/h at any time. Furthermore, a 25 minute drive   away from the Koenigsegg Factory there is Knutstorp Racetrack, which is   described by many as a miniature Nordschleife. Here Koenigsegg can put   the engine and car through serious testing and make sure they work in   perfect harmony. This gives Koenigsegg unique possibilities to develop   technologies normally exclusive to much larger companies.</p>
<p>No other   production engine in the world, regardless of car type, has the same   amount of power potential compared to its EU cycle average CO2   emission(310g of CO2) or cycle fuel consumption( 14,7 litre per 100 km /   16MPG). However, what makes Koenigsegg most proud is how drivable,   smooth, responsive, torquey and reliable the engines are - especially   given their extreme performance.</p>
<p>The Agera engine complies with   the most stringent environmental regulations in the world, EU5 and LEV2,   and delivers a significant power increase compared to previous   Koenigsegg engines.</p>
<p>Fuel consumption, and thus CO2 emissions, has   been lowered. This is an astonishing feat for a 900+ hp hypercar. Turbo   response is of vital importance when it comes to driving pleasure and   the possibility to control massive amounts of power. Therefore   Koenigsegg has joined forces with Borg Warner and adapted to the latest   technology when it comes to turbine materials. The Koenigsegg Agera R   turbines are made from a material called Gamma-Ti which is an inter   metallic compound comprised of aluminium and titanium. This new material   drastically reduces the inertia of the turbine wheel and axle and   therefore gives improved response. Furthermore Koenigsegg has coupled   this latest generation turbo technology with patent pending and   proprietary response/back pressure reduction system, invented by   Christian von Koenigsegg to really give the Agera engine a competitive   edge when combining maximum power while complying with the strictest   emission regulations in the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore the large air to   air intercooler on the left side of the engine sucks enormous amounts of   fresh air, eliminating the need for water in the intercooling system,   thereby saving weight and avoiding heat soak issues, during extended   performance driving.</p>
<p>Following the Koenigsegg tradition the engine   has a dry sump lubrication in order to lower the engine as far as   possible in the chassis and have full control of the crankcase oil even   given the massive g-forces involved.</p>
<p>The large 80-litre tank   ensures long driving range, due to the relatively low average   consumption. The Agera follows the previous generation Koenigsegg and   has its fuel tank well protected, built-in centrally into the carbon   fibre monocoque chassis. Since the fuel is centrally placed in the car,   the weight distribution does not change regardless if the tank is full   or empty. Thanks to the safe fuel tank position, the challenging US   high-speed rear impact test, was passed at first trial.</p>
<p>The   Koenigsegg Agera R has four intelligent bio fuel grade return-less fuel   pumps to deliver the correct amount of fuel at any given time. This   reduces the energy needed to operate the fuel pumps and eliminates the   waste of excessive fuel transport.</p>
<p>The inconel/titanium patent   pending exhaust system is key in order for the Agera to achieve its   remarkable emission and power levels. The exhaust system uses a   completely new principle created by Christian von Koenigsegg. The new   technology drastically reduces back pressure and gives earlier catalytic   light off than any other turbo exhaust system. At the same time the   acoustics of the exhaust has been examined carefully in order to   maintain the typical Koenigsegg thunderous growl.</p>
<h4>THE TRANSMISSION</h4>
<p>The   newly developed 7 speed gearbox for the Agera features a world's first   dual clutch system for a single input shaft gearbox. In order to keep   the gearbox light, compact strong and reliable, Koenigsegg together with   Cima chose to develop a new gearbox type that enables the use of a   combination of a dry and wet clutch system, in order to get class   leading shift times. First there is the normal twin disc dry clutch that   operates in a traditional fashion. Then there is a hydraulically   operated wet clutch-brake inside the gearbox that is engaged during each   up shift in order to slow down the input shaft, simultaneously as the   gears are changed and prior to the normal synchronisation. This cuts the   synchronisation time by two thirds, as the gear is presynchronized. The   result is a very sporty, smooth and extremely fast shift. Compared to a   traditional DCT system, this gearbox is lighter, smaller, has less   moving parts and gives a more distinct shift feel, with almost no   interruption to the acceleration. Furthermore, the electro hydraulic   shift mechanism actuates the shift forks directly with no intermediate   mechanical parts. This brings down the inertia of the shift mechanism   and any potential slack is minimized since the shortest possible path of   engagement is achieved.</p>
<p>The entire transmission weighs only 81   kg, which is by far the lightest 7 speed Hypercar transmission in the   world. The transmission can also be set in full auto mode.</p>
<p>The   small size and very low weight, considering the longitudinal 7 speed   layout, made it possible to maintain the shortest in class rear   overhang, and thereby excellent central mass position and neutral   behaviour in extreme conditions.</p>
<h4>Koenigsegg E-Diff</h4>
<p>The   Koenigsegg Electronic Differential (E-Diff) is lighter and faster,   compared to traditional E-Diff solutions. The difference lies in the   fact that Koenigsegg has retained a limited slip differential with   plates and ramps with a built-in amount of analogue limited slip   functionality. This means that the active hydraulic element can be   smaller, more compact and therefore faster and lighter compared to   traditional E-Diff solutions. The analogue part of the functionality   also has zero processing time as it reacts directly. The analogue system   is supplemented by a digital active system.</p>
<p>This way Koenigsegg   has obtained one of the lightest and fastest E-Diff solution on the   market. Furthermore the Koenigsegg developed algorithms that control the   E-Diff, takes input from; throttle angle, g-force, steering wheel   angle, yaw angle, car speed, engine rpm, selected gear, plus weather   condition.</p>
<p>The way all this data is analysed and how the car   reacts to this data also makes the Koenigsegg E-Diff unique and that   makes the Agera very safe on the limit and improves performance and   feel.</p>
<p>The Koenigsegg E-diff works in harmony with the new traction   control system that is the fastest reacting in the industry, with auto   adapt functionality to different road conditions and driving styles as   well as several manual settings.</p>
<h4>THE CHASSIS</h4>
<p>The   Agera´s unique carbon fibre monocoque chassis is designed to achieve   its maximum stiffness without a roof, as the roof is detachable and   stow-able in the front of the car. This in itself is an unusual feature   for such a compact Hypercar.</p>
<p>The Koenigsegg carbon monocoque   chassis has an astonishing stiffness of 65.000 Nm/deg and only weighs 70   kg including the integrated fuel tanks.</p>
<p>The result of constant   weight saving exercises is a dry weight of only 1330 kg making the Agera   the lightest fully homologated Hypercar presently in production.</p>
<h4>THE SUSPENSION</h4>
<p>The suspension geometry of the Agera was designed to further enhance the award winning behaviour of the CCX.   The Agera track is wider at the front compared to the rear of the car,   compensating for the narrower front tires and giving the car a square   stance of 2 meters in both the front and the rear.</p>
<p>In typical   Koenigsegg tradition, the Agera has the longest wishbones of all   hypercars presently in production. Long wishbones have several   advantages - for example: less track width deviation during wheel   movement or cornering and improved geometry over a longer wheel stroke.   This is one of the reason why F1 cars have very long wishbones. The   wishbones are produced from seamless aeronautical chrome-molybdenum   tubing, in order to minimise weight in combination with maximum strength   and stiffness.</p>
<p>The extremely strong and light uprights are   machined from 7075-T6 aeronautical grade aluminium, and contains 240 mm   SKF dual angle contact bearings, normally only found on Lemans prototype   cars. The very large bearings contribute to the overall stiffness of   the wheel assembly and therefore give better control, handling and   comfort. The uprights have large 4.5&quot; diameter carbon fibre cooling   ducts for the brake discs in order to maximise brake cooling.</p>
<h4>Brakes</h4>
<p>The   Agera is equipped with the absolutely latest ABS technology and is   based upon, a very lightweight and performance oriented, racing ABS   system. The system makes it possible for the ABS function to react to   differently depending on performance mode. Furthermore the ABS braking   system operates on massive 392×36 mm and 380×34 mm ventilated and   drilled ceramic discs, for unparalleled braking performance and zero   fade regardless of track or road condition.</p>
<h4>RTD (Rear Triplex Damper) Suspension</h4>
<p>Christian   von Koenigsegg has invented and pioneered a new type of rear suspension   system for a road car. The Agera has a shock absorber and spring   connecting the right and left rear wheel. This system gives unique   benefits as the two rear wheels can influence one another when desired.</p>
<p>There   are multiple benefits of this system. For example, the extra spring and   damper works in series with the normal spring and dampers allowing   their spring and damping rates to be lowered. This results in increased   comfort and better handling on rough and wet surfaces without   compromising dry track handling.</p>
<p>Furthermore the RTD system has an   anti-squat effect. Traditional anti-squat systems are designed into the   geometry of the suspension. These systems do not add any components or   weight. However they compromise the geometry of the suspension for other   aspects of handling than anti-squat.</p>
<p>By adding the RTD system,   Koenigsegg can maintain true suspension geometries for handling, but   still have the anti-squat feature and harvest other new found benefits.   As the RTD system compliments the normal dampers and springs, these can   be made lighter. Hence, the added benefit does not significantly affect   the overall system weight.</p>
<h4>DEDICATED MICHELIN TIRES</h4>
<p>Koenigsegg   continued its long standing partnership with Michelin in the tire   development for the Agera. Hence the Agera features specially developed,   latest generation Michelin Super sport tires.</p>
<p>Due to the tires,   advanced suspension and aerodynamics, the Agera achieves lateral   accelerations up to 1.6 g in dry conditions with improved handling in   wet.</p>
<p>The new tires were developed for the Agera through testing at the Michelin Ladoux test centre in France.</p>
<p>The   tires fitted to the Agera are rated for speeds over 420 km/h making it   the highest top speed rated tire in the world, whilst offering cup tire   levels of grip and outstanding wet performance , all in one package.</p>
<p>Koenigsegg are very proud of being a selected development partner of Michelin.</p>
<h4>VGR - <span>Vortex Generating Rim spokes</span></h4>
<p>The   Koenigsegg VGR wheels are not only for looks. They are real air   turbines, increasing the down force of the car by measurable amounts and   improve brake cooling. All four wheels are individual so that turbine   blades always face the correct direction for extraction. Given that the   offset and width is different front to rear, all four wheels have their   unique design. The VGR wheels are forged and then fully machined to the   final shape. Due to the forging and machining process all excess   material has been removed minimising weight, whilst displaying   outstanding levels of stiffness.</p>
<h4>THE AERODYNAMICS</h4>
<p>The   Aerodynamics of the Agera has been honed and perfected over many years   in CFD and wind tunnel in order ensure best possible outcome. Even with   the massive dynamic rear wing, the drag of the Agera is only Cd 0.33, in   high speed mode and Cd 0.37 in track mode. Even though the Agera is a   full 2 meters wide, it only has a frontal area of 1.87 m2. This results   in a Cd*A value of only 0.62 and thus a theoretical top speed of around   440 km/h (Agera R), given the gear ratio and power available. All Agera   models are limited to 375 km/h in standard mode, but can be unlocked by   Koenigsegg for shorter periods of time, if all necessary conditions are   met, such as road condition, tire wear, service level of car etc. The   car is set in full speed mode by unlocking the top speed mode in the   Infotainment system.</p>
<p>The two large side air intakes greatly add to   the Agera´s high speed stability as they ensure that the pressure point   of the car is behind the mass centre of the car. This makes the car   more directionally stable with increasing speed. This is a crucial   safety feature when it comes to driving at extreme speeds. Great care   has been taken that the car also is stable under high speed braking. The   front splitter and rear diffuser has been designed and optimized with   this in mind.</p>
<p>For maximum performance and safety it is important   that the down force stays as constant as possible even in yaw   situations. Therefore the rear diffuser was developed and evaluated   specifically to give substantial down force even at wide yaw angles.</p>
<h4>Dynamic rear wing</h4>
<p>Hypercars   of today generate massive amounts of down force in low to medium speed   and less down force in very high speed, in order not to overload the   tires and not to create too much drag. Most hypercars therefore have   heavy hydraulically operated wings and flaps to cater for this need.</p>
<p>Koenigsegg   however, following the &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy, has designed a   dynamic system to that take care of the above described needs. The most   visual and obvious part of this system is the new dynamic rear wing. The   wing changes its angle of attack, not with the help of hydraulics, but   with the pressure of the wind. It is therefore dynamically controlled by   the speed or wind resistance at any given moment in time and thus   actually compensates for headwind or tailwind at the same given speed.   This is an intelligent way of dealing with adaptive aerodynamics, as the   system becomes lighter, less complex and more intuitive compared to   heavy and complex hydraulics systems. Koenigsegg had to work heavily   with CFD in order to create the dynamically controlled adaptive   aerodynamics of the Agera.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an interesting   multifunction feature of the adaptive wing is that the pylons for the   wing also act as air extrusion channels. The air channels goes from the   engine bay to the back of the pylons, thereby creating an air passage.   This causes a venturi effect, from the air rushing past the pylon,   evacuating hot engine bay gases, reducing pressure in the engine bay and   increasing the flow of cooling air through the side radiators. This   also means that the pressure under the car is reduced and giving more   low drag down force.</p>
<h4>THE INTERIOR</h4>
<p>The   interior of the Agera is like no other car. No other materials than   those deemed worthy by Koenigsegg are allowed in the interior. This   means that what you get to touch and see inside the Agera is only   aluminium, carbon fibre, precious metals, alcantara and aniline leather.   All switch gear is highly bespoke and features wonderfully unique   solutions, as for example the Koenigsegg Ghost light, that make solid   aluminium buttons gleam with LED powered symbols appearing out of   nowhere. A world first in the car industry. The illumination shines   through the billet aluminium buttons and surfaces by way of almost   invisible micro holes, creating excellent visibility of the symbols as   well as a very clean and stylish appearance, framed by an all-new carbon   fibre centre console and tunnel assembly.</p>
<p>The new super light   full carbon airbag steering wheel incorporates many vital functions   directly in front of the driver. Similarly to the CCX, the shifting   paddles are mounted directly on the steering wheel to enable shifting   without taking your hands off the steering wheel during hard cornering.</p>
<p>The   central high-definition touch screen infotainment system controls the   audio functions, satellite navigation, Bluetooth phone and secondary   functions such as performance meters and car telemetrical data.</p>
<p>The   very comfortable and optionally heated carbon seats are great for long   journeys but also give excellent lateral support when needed.</p>
<p>The   Interior of the Agera is truly minimalistic and efficient in the purest   Swedish sense. Nothing in the interior is there only to add visual   drama; instead everything is there for a functional purpose. According   to Koenigsegg, this is the essence of beauty, as it follows a less is   more philosophy that embodies every engineering aspect of the Agera.</p>
<h4>CI - Configurable Instruments</h4>
<p>The   CI is specifically developed for the Agera by Koenigsegg. It features a   unique and configurable interface that can be adapted to driver   specific demands. As it is connected to the cars CAN bus system it   freely communicates with the infotainment screen and all other functions   in the car.</p>
<p>By pushing the left stalk button, different priority   graphics can be chosen, depending on need. For example in track driving   mode, there is a focus on; RPM, pressures, temperatures, lap times, and   g-forces. Compared to GT mode, where: car speed, auto shift, satnav,   power, music etc is prioritized.</p>
<h4>THE LUGGAGE SPACE</h4>
<p>The   luggage space is something Koenigsegg is very proud of. It is the   largest luggage compartment in the hypercar world, with a space of over   120 litres. It is so well shaped that it actually can fit the one piece   Agera roof/hardtop, meaning the driver can choose to go open or closed   at any given time during a longer trip. Given the fact that Koenigsegg   has engineered the roof to fit the car, it is actually also possible fit   a set of golf clubs. This is unheard of in the hypercar world. Given   the high comfort level and the large luggage space, the Agera can truly   been seen as one of the first GT hypercars.</p>
<h4>Custom Carbon fibre Thule Lightning Roof Box</h4>
<p>At   the 2011 Geneva Motor show, Koenigsegg presents the Koenigsegg winter   package - the first lifestyle packages offered from Koenigsegg. The main   element of this package is the exceptional Lightning Roof Box System.</p>
<p>The   Lightning Roof Box is developed together with the Swedish rack and roof   box manufacturer Thule. The high performance lightweight box is made   completely from carbon fibre and has been through several iterations of   CFD simulation to ensure it is safe up to 300 km/h, making it the   fastest roof box in the world.</p>
<p>The roof box, which has an   incorporated roof panel, replaces the normal roof in under 10 minutes.   The standard roof is then stored in the luggage compartment in the front   of the car, so that when the driver arrives to his destination, the   roof box can be quickly removed and the normal roof can be put in place   for a more elegant look.</p>
<p>The Lightning roof box truly enables the   driver to use the Agera for longer trips with massive luggage. This   gives a whole new spectrum of hypercar utilization.</p>
<p>The winter   package also includes Michelin snow tires on forged Koenigsegg wheels   and custom designed Koenigsegg skis from the Swedish high end ski   manufacturer, Extrem.</p>
<p>Part of the winter package is also a Swedish   winter resort experience in Åre - Sweden's most popular skiing resort   and the place of manufacture of the Koenigsegg skis.</p>
<p>During the   stay in Åre, the Koenigsegg customers will be fitted for their skis and   they can witness first hand when they are being hand made in &quot;Åres   skidfabrik&quot;, a state of the art ski production plant.</p>
<p>While their   skis are being made, they will be checked into the delightful Copperhill   Mountain Lodge that is towering snow-capped forests and sparkling   frozen lakes.</p>
<p>The following day the skis are ready for use and   Åre´s many and varied ski slopes are available for test runs, in direct   access from the Copperhill Mountain Lodge.</p>
<p>Together with the Golf club options this marks the start of the Koenigsegg extended lifestyle program for Koenigsegg cars.</p>
<p>We   would also like to thank Full Tilt, Houdini Sportswear, Sweet   Protection, Sport Lodge'n Trysil and Moods of Norway, for assisting us   in creating the winter experience at the Geneva motorshow.</p>
<h4>THE ELECTRONICS</h4>
<p>Not   only does Koenigsegg develop their own engines, but also many of the   electronic control units, CAN protocols, and management strategies are   developed in-house. If you would look closely at many of the circuit   boards in the car, inside the control units, you will find the name   Koenigsegg in scripted directly on the circuit boards.</p>
<p>Of course   there is no self fulfilling need to develop so many critical items   in-house, unless it gives the car a competitive edge doing so. This is   actually the main reason for Koenigsegg doing it. This, for example,   gave Koenigsegg the possibility to pioneer the CCXR and Agera R - the   two first environmentally conscious hypercars in the world.</p>
<p>An   example of this development is In the Semiconductor Electric Control   Central. The ECC controls most of the electronic functions in the car.   Most physical fuses or relays have been replaced by software controlled   semiconductors which are configurable in function and enable monitoring   all power and threshold values. The ECC communicates via CAN with the   infotainment system in order to display necessary information to the   driver. For example if a door is open, a lamp is broken, or not all roof   locks are tight in place, information will appear on the instruments as   all electrical functions are controlled and monitored by the ECC.</p>
<h4>Intelligent Lifepo4 Battery</span> - ILB</h4>
<p>The   Agera is the first combustion engine powered production car in the   world, with an intelligent Lithium Iron battery as standard equipment.   First of all, this battery type saves significant weight and is more   compact compared to traditional led acid batteries. Secondly lithium   iron cells cannot reach thermal runway, unlike Li-ion batteries, which   makes them very safe for automotive use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ILB   carries many intelligent functions, developed by Koenigsegg together   with the battery supplier. Hypercars tend to be parked long periods of   time and therefore their batteries can be drained if the car is not   hooked up to a trickle charger. Even though all Koenigsegg cars come as   standard with a trickle charger it is not always easy to remember, or   even possible depending on location, to use it. It is also possible that   a driver sometime forgets to turn off all consumers, like parking   lights etc causing early battery drainage.</p>
<p>Koenigsegg has   therefore implemented a minimum current protection mode, to make the   above issues something of the past. The new ILB therefore has an   intelligent circuit built into it, so if the car is left on or standing   for a long time, the battery shuts down when the voltage drops below a   certain threshold. The shut down does not occur sooner than a   traditional battery would have been left depleted and useless, so it   does not take away any expected battery capacity. Then, if any essential   buttons or a door knob is touched, the battery kicks back into life for   5 minutes and has enough power to operate all the functionalities in   the car and start the engine and thereby giving charge back to the   battery.</p>
<p>Given this strategy, battery concerns are a thing of the   past. No matter of the behaviour of the car user. To prove a point you   can leave the car with the high beam on and the stereo at full blast in   the evening, without the engine running. Wake up in the morning, open   the car door, start the engine and drive away. Alternatively, leave the   car for a couple of months, open the door, start the car and drive away.</p>
